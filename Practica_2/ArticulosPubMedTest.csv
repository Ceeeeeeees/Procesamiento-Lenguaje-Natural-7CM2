10.1016/j.cmet.2025.02.007,Dietary timing enhances exercise by modulating fat-muscle crosstalk via adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling.,"Chen, Jianghui,Xiang, Jing,Zhou, Meiyu,Huang, Rongfeng,Zhang, Jianxin,Cui, Yuanting,Jiang, Xiaoqing,Li, Yang,Zhou, Runchao,Xin, Haoran,Li, Jie,Li, Lihua,Lam, Sin Man,Zhu, Jianfang,Chen, Yanxiu,Yang, Qingyuan,Xie, Zhifu,Shui, Guanghou,Deng, Fang,Zhang, Zhihui,Li, Min-Dian","Feeding rhythms regulate exercise performance and muscle energy metabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating adipocyte functions remain unclear. Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance.",16/07/2024,Cell metabolism
10.3390/jimaging10080192,RailTrack-DaViT: A Vision Transformer-Based Approach for Automated Railway Track Defect Detection.,"Phaphuangwittayakul, Aniwat,Harnpornchai, Napat,Ying, Fangli,Zhang, Jinming","Railway track defects pose significant safety risks and can lead to accidents, economic losses, and loss of life. Traditional manual inspection methods are either time-consuming, costly, or prone to human error. This paper proposes RailTrack-DaViT, a novel vision transformer-based approach for railway track defect classification. By leveraging the Dual Attention Vision Transformer (DaViT) architecture, RailTrack-DaViT effectively captures both global and local information, enabling accurate defect detection. The model is trained and evaluated on multiple datasets including rail, fastener and fishplate, multi-faults, and ThaiRailTrack. A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance is provided including confusion matrices, training visualizations, and classification metrics. RailTrack-DaViT demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, achieving the highest accuracies: 96.9% on the rail dataset, 98.9% on the fastener and fishplate dataset, and 98.8% on the multi-faults dataset. Moreover, RailTrack-DaViT outperforms baselines on the ThaiRailTrack dataset with 99.2% accuracy, quickly adapts to unseen images, and shows better model stability during fine-tuning. This capability can significantly reduce time consumption when applying the model to novel datasets in practical applications.",22/06/2024,Journal of imaging

To date, the understanding of the molecular and genomic heterogeneity of HGSC is based primarily on the evaluation of tumors from White individuals. In the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing on HGSC samples from 211 Black patients to identify significantly mutated genes and characterize mutational signatures, assessing their distributions by gene expression subtypes. The occurrence and frequency of somatic mutations and signatures by self-reported race were compared to historical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Despite technical differences (e.g., formalin-fixed vs. fresh-frozen tissue), the distribution of mutations and their variant classifications for major HGSC genes were nearly identical across study populations. However, de novo significantly mutated gene analysis identified genes not previously reported in the TCGA analysis, including the oncogene KRAS and the potential tumor suppressor OBSCN. The prevalence of the homologous recombination deficiency signature was higher among Black individuals with the immunoreactive gene expression subtype compared with the mesenchymal and proliferative subtypes. These findings were confirmed by comparing the data from Black patients to 123 White patients with identical tissue collection and processing. Overall, this study suggests that, while most features of HGSC tumor phenotypes are similar in Black and White populations, there may be clinically-relevant differences. If validated, these phenotypes may be important for clinical decision-making and would have been missed by characterizing tumors from White individuals only.",10/03/2025,Cancer research

Here we observed a spatial and HCC recurrence-associated distribution of natural killer (NK) cells in the invasive front and tumour centre from 61 patients. Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front. Our study introduces TIMES, a publicly accessible tool for predicting HCC recurrence risk, offering insights into its potential to inform treatment decisions for early-stage HCC.",12/03/2025,Nature

10.3390/ijms26052320,Unveiling Gestational Diabetes: An Overview of Pathophysiology and Management,"Rahul Mittal,Karan Prasad,Joana R N Lemos,Giuliana Arevalo,Khemraj Hirani","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by an inadequate pancreatic β-cell response to pregnancy-induced insulin resistance, resulting in hyperglycemia. The pathophysiology involves reduced incretin hormone secretion and signaling, specifically decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), impairing insulinotropic effects. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), impair insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation, disrupting insulin-mediated glucose uptake. β-cell dysfunction in GDM is associated with decreased pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) expression, increased endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (CHOP, GRP78), and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to impaired ATP production and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Excessive gestational weight gain exacerbates insulin resistance through hyperleptinemia, which downregulates insulin receptor expression via JAK/STAT signaling. Additionally, hypoadiponectinemia decreases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in skeletal muscle, impairing GLUT4 translocation. Placental hormones such as human placental lactogen (hPL) induce lipolysis, increasing circulating free fatty acids which activate protein kinase C, inhibiting insulin signaling. Placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) overactivity elevates cortisol levels, which activate glucocorticoid receptors to further reduce insulin sensitivity. GDM diagnostic thresholds (≥92 mg/dL fasting, ≥153 mg/dL post-load) are lower than type 2 diabetes to prevent fetal hyperinsulinemia and macrosomia. Management strategies focus on lifestyle modifications, including dietary carbohydrate restriction and exercise. Pharmacological interventions, such as insulin or metformin, aim to restore AMPK signaling and reduce hepatic glucose output. Emerging therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, show potential in improving glycemic control and reducing inflammation. A mechanistic understanding of GDM pathophysiology is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to prevent both adverse pregnancy outcomes and the progression to overt diabetes in affected women.",05/03/2025,International journal of molecular sciences

Here, we present a spatial transcriptomic map at single-cell resolution, encompassing 127 multi-stage fields of view from 43 patients, to chart the evolutionary trajectories of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). By analyzing 6.4 million cells, we reveal that ESCC progression is driven by a proliferative epithelial cell subpopulation that acquires dedifferentiated and invasive characteristics. At the late precancerous stage, these cells disrupt the epithelial-stromal interface and recruit normal fibroblasts via JAG1-NOTCH1 signaling, transforming them into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This interaction leads to the formation of a ""CAF-Epi"" (CAF and epithelial cell) niche at the tumor edge that shields the tumor from immune surveillance.

However, the role of mitochondrial metabolism in tumor immunity remains unclear. The present study integrates spatial transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics and proteomics, revealing a strong link between the metabolite succinyl-CoA and tumor immunity as well as the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy in patients with melanoma. Elevated succinyl-CoA levels, through α-ketoglutarate or succinate supplementation, enhanced T cell-mediated tumor elimination, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, succinylation of the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) at lysine 129 led to its degradation. Increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), identified as a succinyltransferase for PD-L1, boosted anti-tumor activity. Preclinically, bezafibrate, a hyperlipidemia drug, upregulated CPT1A and synergized with CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody to inhibit tumor growth. Clinically, higher PD-L1 and lower CPT1A levels in tumors correlated with better anti-PD-1 therapy responses, suggesting potential biomarkers for prediction of treatment efficacy.",03/2025,Nature genetics

However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood 1-5 . Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.",12/03/2025,Nature

We demonstrate that ecDNAs drive varying levels of MYC dosage, depending on their regulatory landscape, enabling cancer cells to rapidly and reversibly adapt to microenvironmental changes. In the absence of selective pressure, a high ecDNA copy number imposes a substantial fitness cost on PDAC cells.

The cuproptosis suppression has been characterized in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we reveal that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a driver of cuproptosis resistance in solid tumor. We found that HIF-1α activates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and 3 (PDK1/3), resulting in decreased expression of dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT) (target of copper), and promotes the accumulation of metallothionein, which sequesters mitochondrial copper, leading to resistance to cuproptosis under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we discovered that high levels of copper reduce ubiquitination and increase the stability of HIF-1α protein without affecting its mRNA levels. Inhibition of HIF-1α increases the susceptibility of cancer to cuproptosis in vivo. This study unveils the multifaceted role of HIF-1α in cuproptosis and demonstrates the molecular mechanism of hypoxia-promoted carcinogenesis.",04/03/2025,Cancer cell

Here, we reveal that STING signaling induces PD-L1 hi tumor monocytes (Tu.Mons) that dominate the resistance against STING agonist therapy. Cell-intrinsic PD-L1, induced by the STING-IRF3-IFN-I axis, is identified as the driving factor for protumoral PD-L1 hi Tu.Mons. Notably, TLR2-activated Tu.Mons resist STING-induced upregulation of cell-intrinsic PD-L1 and the associated protumoral functions. Mechanistically, TLR2 stimulation remodels STING signaling by facilitating STING and TRAF6 interaction, which suppresses the IRF3-IFN-I response and enhances NF-κB activation. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining STING agonists with TLR2 agonist pretreatment significantly improves antitumor efficacy in murine syngeneic and humanized models.

MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion 2 and systemic hyperinflammation 3 . The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5 ). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.",12/03/2025,Nature

Olezarsen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the mRNA for apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III), a protein known to impair TG clearance by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase and the hepatic uptake of triglycerides and triglyceride-rich remnants. Olezarsen has been evaluated in patients with predominantly moderate HTG (150-499 mg/dl) and a rare genetic condition known as Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS), with TG lowering effects of 53% and 44%, respectively, and reductions in pancreatitis among the FCS population. However, no dedicated trial has tested olezarsen in patients with severe HTG. In these two pivotal phase 3 trials, CORE -TIMI 72a ( NCT05079919 ) and CORE2 -TIMI 72b ( NCT05552326 ), over 1,000 patients with severe HTG will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either olezarsen (80 mg or 50 mg dose) or matching placebo. Patients will be treated for a total of 53 weeks and evaluated for the primary endpoint of percent change in TGs from baseline to 6 months compared to placebo. Pooled analyses of CORE and CORE2 will also assess olezarsen's effect on acute pancreatitis events and change in hepatic steatosis. Together, CORE -TIMI 72a ( NCT05079919 ) and CORE2 -TIMI 72b ( NCT05552326 ) are designed to establish the efficacy and safety of olezarsen in patients with severe HTG.",08/03/2025,American heart journal

Despite interest in bifidobacteria as a live biotic therapy, our understanding of colonization, host-microbe interactions, and the health-promoting effects of bifidobacteria is limited. To address these major knowledge gaps, we used a large-scale genetic approach to create a mutant fitness compendium in Bifidobacterium breve. First, we generated a high-density randomly barcoded transposon insertion pool and used it to determine fitness requirements during colonization of germ-free mice and chickens with multiple diets and in response to hundreds of in vitro perturbations. Second, to enable mechanistic investigation, we constructed an ordered collection of insertion strains covering 1,462 genes.

However, research over the past ten years has unveiled multifaceted functions of lactate that critically shape and impact cellular biology. Beyond serving as a fuel source, lactate is now known to influence gene expression through histone modification and to function as a signaling molecule that impacts a wide range of cellular activities. These properties have been particularly studied in the context of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Here, we review the diverse roles of lactate in the regulation of the immune system during homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (including cancer, infection, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmunity).

In our study, we conducted a comprehensive screening of 217 older male volunteer donors with a history of extensive blood donation (>100 life-time donations) to investigate the phenomenon of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). No significant difference in the overall incidence of CH was found in frequent donors (FD) compared to sporadic donors (<10 life-time donations, 212 donors). However, upon deeper analysis of mutations in DNMT3A, the most commonly affected gene in CH, we observed distinct mutational patterns between the FD and age/sex matched control donor (CD) cohorts. Functional analysis of FD enriched DNMT3A variants examined in CRISPR-edited human HSCs demonstrated their competitive outgrowth potential upon stimulation with erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone which increases in response to blood loss. In contrast, clones harboring leukemogenic DNMT3A R882 mutations increase upon stimulation with IFNy. Through concurrent mutational and immunophenotypic profiling of primary samples at single cell resolution, a myeloid bias of premalignant R882 mutant HSCs was found, while no significant lineage bias was observed in HSCs harboring EPO responsive DNMT3A variants. The latter exhibited preferential erythroid differentiation when persistent erythropoietic stress was applied to CRISPR-edited human HSC xenografts. Our data demonstrate a nuanced ongoing Darwinian evolution at the somatic stem cell level, with EPO identified as a novel environmental factor that favors HSCs carrying certain DNMT3A mutations.",11/03/2025,Blood

In 1993, the World Health Organisation declared TB a global emergency. Passive case-finding is an important part of TB control programmes, and this is strongly affected by people's perceptions and beliefs of TB and society's behaviour towards TB sufferers. The aim of this study was to describe the perceptions and beliefs of Vietnamese people regarding TB and its risk factors with special reference to differences between men and women. Sixteen focus group discussions (FGDs) were organised in four districts representing different regions in Vietnam and consisting of men and women, TB patients and non-TB participants. In general, participants had good knowledge of TB being a dangerous, contagious and infectious disease, caused by germs. However, traditional beliefs in different types of TB still exist, mainly among older people in rural areas, but also resorted to by other people once ill. Four main types of TB were reported: (1) 'Lao truyen' (hereditary TB), handed down from older generations to latter ones through 'family blood', regardless of sexes; (2) 'Lao luc' (physical TB), caused by hard work, more men affected; (3) 'Lao tam' (mental TB), caused by too much worrying-more women affected; and (4) 'Lao phoi' (lung TB), dangerous and caused by TB germs, transmitted through the respiratory system-more men affected. Other general risk factors were also mentioned. Men were perceived to get TB more often than women, as they were more exposed to risk factors during both work and leisure time. These traditional beliefs may contribute to long delays to TB diagnosis and increased social stigma and isolation of TB patients and their families due to erroneous beliefs in transmission routes. Our findings demonstrate areas where TB control programmes may be improved.",09/1999,Social science & medicine (1982)

Key signaling hubs in this network include insulin/IGF-1, AMPK, mTOR, and sirtuins. The Hippo/Mammalian Ste20-like Kinase1 (MST1) pathway has been reported to maintain lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, but its role has not been studied in higher metazoans. In this study, we report that overexpression of Hpo, the MST1 homolog in Drosophila melanogaster, decreased lifespan with concomitant changes in lipid metabolism and aging-associated gene expression, while RNAi Hpo depletion increased lifespan. These effects were mediated primarily by Hpo-induced transcriptional activation of the RNA-binding protein maternal expression at 31B (Me31b)/RCK, resulting in stabilization of mRNA-encoding a lipolytic hormone, Akh. In mouse adipocytes, Hpo/Mst1 mediated adipocyte differentiation, phosphorylation of RNA-binding proteins such as Rck, decapping MRNA 2 (Dcp2), enhancer Of MRNA decapping 3 (Edc3), nucleolin (NCL), and glucagon mRNA stability by interacting with Rck. Decreased lifespan in Hpo-overexpressing Drosophila lines required expression of Me31b, but not DCP2, which was potentially mediated by recovering expression of lipid metabolic genes and formation of lipid droplets. Taken together, our findings suggest that Hpo/Mst1 plays a conserved role in longevity by regulating adipogenesis and fatty acid metabolism.",11/03/2025,Aging cell

Here, we show that off-target intestinal low-dose irradiation (ILDR) increases the clinical benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy in eight retrospective cohorts of cancer patients and in tumor-bearing mice. The abscopal effects of ILDR depend on dosimetry (≥1 and ≤3 Gy) and on the metabolic and immune host-microbiota interaction at baseline allowing CD8 + T cell activation without exhaustion. Various strains of Christensenella minuta selectively boost the anti-cancer efficacy of ILDR and PD-L1 blockade, allowing emigration of intestinal PD-L1-expressing dendritic cells to tumor-draining lymph nodes.

The inability to target antigen-low cells is an intrinsic vulnerability of second-generation CAR T cells and underlies most relapses following CD22BBz CAR T cell therapy. Here, we interrogate CD22BBz CAR signaling in response to low antigen and find inefficient phosphorylation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) limiting downstream signaling. To overcome this, we designed the adjunctive LAT-activating CAR T cell (ALA-CART) platform, pairing a second-generation CAR with a LAT-CAR incorporating the intracellular domain of LAT. ALA-CART cells demonstrate reduced differentiation during manufacturing and increased LAT phosphorylation, MAPK signaling, and AP-1 activity. ALA-CART cells show improved cytotoxicity, proliferation, persistence, and efficacy against antigen-low leukemias that were refractory to clinically active CD22BBz CAR T cells.

However, unlocking its power requires a mechanistic understanding of how bacteria both evade antimicrobial immune defenses and stimulate anti-tumor immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, by harnessing an engineered Salmonella enterica strain with this dual proficiency, we unveil an underlying singular mechanism. Specifically, the hysteretic nonlinearity of interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) expression drives tumor-infiltrated immune cells into a tumor-specific IL-10R hi state. Bacteria leverage this to enhance tumor-associated macrophages producing IL-10, evade phagocytosis by tumor-associated neutrophils, and coincidently expand and stimulate the preexisting exhausted tumor-resident CD8 + T cells. This effective combination eliminates tumors, prevents recurrence, and inhibits metastasis across multiple tumor types. Analysis of human samples suggests that the IL-10R hi state might be a ubiquitous trait across human tumor types.

Although the governing role of energy metabolism in shaping the inflammatory phenotype and function of immune cells has been increasingly recognized, the specific alterations in microglial bioenergetics post-TBI remain poorly understood. Itaconate, a metabolite produced by the enzyme aconitate decarboxylase 1 [IRG1; encoded by immune responsive gene 1 ( Irg1 )], is a pivotal metabolic regulator in immune cells, particularly in macrophages. Because microglia are macrophages of the brain parenchyma, the IRG1/itaconate pathway likely modulates microglial inflammatory responses. In this study, we explored the role of the IRG1/itaconate pathway in regulating microglial bioenergetics and inflammatory activation post-TBI using a mouse controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. We isolated microglia before and 4 and 12 hours after TBI and observed a swift but transient increase in glycolysis coupled with a prolonged disruption of mitochondrial metabolism after injury. Despite an up-regulation of Irg1 expression, itaconate in microglia declined after TBI. Microglia-specific Irg1 gene knockout ( Irg1 -Mi-KO) exacerbated metabolic changes, intensified proinflammatory activation and neurodegeneration, and worsened certain long-term neurological deficits. Supplementation with 4-octyl itaconate (OI) reinstated the use and oxidative metabolism of glucose, glutamine, and fatty acid, thereby enhancing microglial bioenergetics post-TBI. OI supplementation also attenuated proinflammatory activation and neurodegeneration and improved long-term neurological outcomes. These results suggest that therapeutically targeting the itaconate pathway could improve microglial energy metabolism and neurological outcomes after TBI.",12/03/2025,Science translational medicine

This approach has shown remarkable success in treating various hematologic malignancies and is now expanding into clinical trials for solid tumors, such as prostate cancer and glioblastoma, as well as infectious and autoimmune diseases. CAR-T cell therapy involves harvesting a patient's T cells, genetically engineering them with viral vectors to express CARs targeting specific antigens and reinfusing the modified cells into the patient.

Although targeting ceramide signaling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate ASCVD remains elusive. We examined whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We performed a systematic screen combining G protein signaling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of GPCRs expression, and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the results suggested CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-evoked inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. We found that inhibiting CYSLTR2/P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviated ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Additionally, increased ceramide levels correlated with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2/P2RY6 deficiency mitigated chronic kidney disease (CKD)-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice, without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analysis of the ceramide-CYSLTR2-Gq complexes revealed that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind within an inclined channel-like ligand binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further revealed an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramides-induced CYSLTR2 activation and CYSLTR2-Gq interface. Overall, our study provided structural and molecular mechanisms that long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signaling through directly binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors, and blocking these signaling may provide new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases.",06/03/2025,Nature

However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of m 6 A in IAV RNA. In the present study, we identified the m 6 A methylation of the viral RNA of different IAV subtypes and confirmed that m 6 A modification promotes the polymerase activity and replication of IAV. By mutating m 6 A motifs on the multiple viral RNAs (vRNAs) of IAV, we revealed that m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the expression of viral genes and the replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA reduced the pathogenicity of IAV in a mouse model. Mechanistically, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the assembly of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex by impairing the interaction between vRNA and vRNP proteins in an m 6 A methyltransferase-dependent manner, but not the m 6 A reader proteins. Together, our findings reveal an important role for m 6 A on viral RNAs in facilitating the activity of the polymerase complex and the replication and pathogenicity of IAV, which provides insights for the development of novel anti-influenza strategies.",18/03/2025,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

Dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins translated from both sense and antisense repeats, especially arginine-rich DPRs (R-DPRs), contribute to neurodegeneration. Through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening in human-derived neurons, we identified receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase S (PTPσ) as a strong modifier of poly-GR-mediated toxicity. We showed that reducing PTPσ promotes the survival of both poly-GR- and poly-PR-expressing neurons by elevating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), accompanied by restored early endosomes and lysosomes. Remarkably, PTPσ knockdown or inhibition substantially rescues the PI3P-endolysosomal defects and improves the survival of C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient-derived neurons. Furthermore, the PTPσ inhibitor diminishes GR toxicity and rescues pathological and behavioral phenotypes in mice. Overall, these findings emphasize the critical role of PI3P-mediated endolysosomal deficits induced by R-DPRs in disease pathogenesis and reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPσ in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD.",10/03/2025,Neuron

Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in VSMCs plays a pivotal role because it constitutes an essential osteogenic transcription factor for bone formation. As a key DNA demethylation enzyme, ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) is crucial in maintaining the VSMC phenotype. However, whether TET2 involves in VC progression remains elusive. Here we identified a substantial downregulation of TET2 in calcified human and mouse arteries, as well as human primary VSMCs. In vitro gain- and loss-of function experiments demonstrated TET2 regulated VC. Subsequently, in vivo knockdown of TET2 significantly exacerbated VC in both vitamin D3 and adenine-diet-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) mice models. Mechanistically, TET2 binds to and suppresses the activity of the P2 promoter within the RUNX2 gene, whereas an enzymatic loss-of-function mutation of TET2 has a comparable effect. Furthermore, TET2 forms a complex with histone deacetylases 1/2 (HDAC1/2 ) to deacetylate H3K27ac on the P2 promoter, thereby inhibiting its transcription. Moreover, SNIP1 is indispensable for TET2 to interact with HDAC1/2 to exert inhibitory effect on VC, and knockdown of SNIP1 accelerated VC in mice. Collectively, our findings imply that TET2 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for VC.",11/03/2025,The Journal of clinical investigation

By performing a CRISPR/Cas9 metabolic survey in CD8 + T cells, we identified 83 targets and we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to disclose transcriptome changes associated with each metabolic perturbation in the context of pancreatic cancer. This revealed elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 1 (Elovl1) as a metabolic target to sustain effector functions and memory phenotypes in CD8 + T cells. Accordingly, Elovl1 inactivation in adoptively transferred T cells combined with anti-PD-1 showed therapeutic efficacy in resistant pancreatic and melanoma tumours. The accumulation of saturated long-chain fatty acids in Elovl1-deficient T cells destabilized INSIG1, leading to SREBP2 activation, increased plasma membrane cholesterol and stronger T cell receptor signalling. Elovl1-deficient T cells increased mitochondrial fitness and fatty acid oxidation, thus withstanding the metabolic stress imposed by the tumour microenvironment.

Advances in screening, multiomics and experimental approaches have revealed insights into host-microbiota interactions in IBD and have identified numerous mechanisms through which the microbiota and its metabolites can exert a major influence on the gastrointestinal tract. Looking into the future, the microbiome and microbiota-associated processes will be likely to provide unparalleled opportunities for novel diagnostic, therapeutic and diet-inspired solutions for the management of IBD through harnessing rationally designed microbial communities, powerful bacterial and fungal metabolites, individually or in combination, to foster intestinal health.

However, the current symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies have achieved limited benefits for neurodegenerative diseases in clinical settings. Halting the progress of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline or even improving impaired cognition and function are the clinically meaningful goals of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Ageing is the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases and their associated comorbidities, such as vascular pathologies, in elderly individuals. Thus, we aim to elucidate the role of ageing in neurodegenerative diseases from the perspective of a complex system, in which the brain is the core and peripheral organs and tissues form a holistic network to support brain functions. During ageing, the progressive deterioration of the structure and function of the entire body hampers its active and adaptive responses to various stimuli, thereby rendering individuals more vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, we propose that the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases should be grounded in holistic antiageing and rejuvenation means complemented by interventions targeting disease-specific pathogenic events. This integrated approach is a promising strategy to effectively prevent, pause or slow down the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",10/03/2025,Signal transduction and targeted therapy

Recent advancements have revealed the intricate immune mechanisms that plants deploy against viral pathogens 3-8 . However, the molecular mechanisms through which plant hosts recognize viral infections and initiate antiviral defence at disease onset have not been elucidated. Here, through the natural infection of rice by inoculation with insect vectors carrying the natural forms of viruses, we show that viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1-IBR-RING2-type ubiquitin ligase (RBRL), initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice. RBRL subsequently targets an adaptor protein of the transcriptional repression complex of the jasmonate pathway, NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ 3 (NINJA3), for degradation through the ubiquitination system, inducing jasmonate signalling and activating downstream antiviral defence. We further show that this phenomenon is a universal molecular mechanism used by rice plants to perceive viral infections and initiate antiviral signalling cascades.

Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), as a part of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in the inflammatory process of heterogeneous cardiac disorders. However, the role of ILC2 in regulating sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that autophagic flux blockage exacerbated inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction, which was associated with mortality of sepsis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model, we observed an expansion of ILC2s in the septic heart. Furthermore, IL4 derived from ILC2 mitigated cardiac inflammatory responses and improved cardiac function during sepsis. Additionally, IL4 enhanced LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2) expression through STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation to stabilize lysosomal homeostasis and rescue the impaired autophagic flux during sepsis. Notably, LAMP2 was preferentially bound to FLOT2 (flotillin 2) after IL4 exposure, and the interaction enhanced autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiac endothelial cells. Loss of FLOT2 reversed the regulatory effects of LAMP2 on autophagy mediated by IL4, leading to autophagosome accumulation and suppressed autophagosome clearance. Conclusively, these findings provide novel insights that ILC2 regulates incomplete autophagic flux to protect septic heart and expand our understanding of immunoregulation for sepsis.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function.

The mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Here, in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies SFRP2 as a potential stromal regulator of the abscopal effect. SFRP2 exhibits cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-specific expression and radioimmunotherapy-mediated upregulation in unirradiated tumors. Conditional Sfrp2 knockout in CAFs boosts the abscopal effect by rewiring the vascular-immune microenvironment to promote CD8 + T cell recruitment to unirradiated tumors. In vivo lineage tracing reveals that elevated SFRP2 correlates with radioimmunotherapy-driven pericyte lineage commitment. Serum proteomics reveals that irradiated-tumor-secreted PAI-1 triggers distant tumor pericyte cell-fate transition into SFRP2 high CAFs via the LRP1/p65 axis. Pharmacologically blocking SFRP2 or PAI-1 enhances the abscopal effect in humanized patient-derived xenograft models.

Intriguingly, cholesterol metabolism is aberrantly regulated in the preneoplastic AIS stage. Importantly, target ablation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the initiation of LUAD. Furthermore, sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress is demonstrated to be a hallmark and a reliable biomarker of AIS progression to IAC. Consistently, target promotion of ER stress profoundly retards LUAD progression. Our study provides comprehensive proteogenomic landscape of SSNs, sheds lights on the tumorigenesis and progression of SSNs and suggests preventive and therapeutic strategies for LUAD.",11/03/2025,Nature communications

In Europe, IFIs are primarily associated with transplantation, intensive care, and chronic diseases. Inspired by initiatives in the Caribbean and Latin America in 2019, efforts to map global diagnostic and treatment resources expanded to Africa, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. This study conducts a comparative analysis, mainly drawing data from Brazil and Europe, to investigate IFI epidemiology and management. Data were collected through online surveys distributed to Brazilian and European institutions, with collaborations from scientific organizations. Surveys covered institutional profiles, IFI diagnoses, accessibility to diagnostic techniques, and antifungal drugs. A comparative survey involving 96 Brazilian and 388 European institutions revealed variations in the perception and practices related to fungal pathogens. Differences in ranking and prevalence were observed, along with variations in diagnostic procedures, fluorescence dye usage, culture practices, antifungal medication availability, and technological approaches. Europe exhibited higher utilization rates for molecular diagnostic approaches, including PCR tests, and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was more widespread in Europe compared with Brazil, indicating substantial differences in understanding and managing fungal infections. Customized IFI management is crucial, considering regional differences and addressing technological gaps like underutilized PCR.

Trials 1 and 2 used 16 cows (106 to 368 d in milk) grouped in 8 pairs of 1 high- and 1 low-FCE cow less than 16 d in milk apart. Trial 1 determined the repeatability of FCE during a 12-wk period. Trial 2 quantified the digestive and metabolic partitioning of energy and N with a 3-d total fecal and urine collection and measurement of CH4 and CO2 emission. Trial 3 studied selected ruminal methanogens in 2 pairs of cows fitted with rumen cannulas. Cows received a single diet including 28% corn silage, 27% alfalfa silage, 17% crude protein, and 28% neutral detergent fiber (dry matter basis). In trial 1, mean FCE remained repeatedly different and averaged 1.83 and 1.03 for high- and low-FCE cows, respectively. In trial 2, high-FCE cows consumed 21% more DMI, produced 98% more fat- and protein-corrected milk, excreted 42% less manure per kilogram of fat- and protein-corrected milk, but emitted the same daily amount of CH4 and CO2 compared with low-FCE cows. Percentage of gross energy intake lost in feces was higher (28.6 vs. 25.9%), but urinary (2.76 vs. 3.40%) and CH4 (5.23 vs. 6.99%) losses were lower in high- than low-FCE cows. Furthermore, high-FCE cows partitioned 15% more of gross energy intake toward net energy for maintenance, body gain, and lactation (37.5 vs. 32.6%) than low-FCE cows. Lower metabolic efficiency and greater heat loss in low-FCE cows might have been associated in part with greater energy demand for immune function related to subclinical mastitis, as somatic cell count was 3.8 fold greater in low- than high-FCE cows. As a percentage of N intake, high-FCE cows tended to have greater fecal N (32.4 vs. 30.3%) and had lower urinary N (32.2 vs. 41.7%) and greater milk N (30.3 vs. 19.1%) than low-FCE cows. In trial 3, Methanobrevibacter spp. strain AbM4 was less prevalent in ruminal content of high-FCE cows, which emitted less CH4 per unit of DMI and per unit of neutral detergent fiber digested than low-FCE cows. Thus lower digestive efficiency was more than compensated by greater metabolic efficiencies in high- compared with low-FCE cows. There was not a single factor, but rather a series of mechanisms involved in the observed differences in efficiency of energy utilization of the lactating cows in this study.",06/2015,Journal of dairy science

Prominent neurodevelopmental models posit that heightened reward-seeking and risk-taking during adolescence result from maturational imbalances between frontostriatal neural systems underlying reward processing and cognitive control. The present study investigated whether the development of ventral (VS) and dorsal (DS) striatal resting-state connectivity (rsFC) networks along this proposed functional gradient relates to putative imbalances between reward and executive systems posited by a dual neural systems theory of adolescent development. 163 participants aged 11-25 years (54% female, 90% white) underwent resting scans at baseline and biennially thereafter, yielding 339 scans across four assessment waves. We observed developmental increases in VS rsFC with brain areas implicated in reward processing (e.g., subgenual cingulate gyrus and medial orbitofrontal cortex) and concurrent decreases with areas implicated in executive function (e.g., ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices). DS rsFC exhibited the opposite pattern. More rapid developmental increases in VS rsFC with reward areas were associated with developmental improvements in reward-based decision making, whereas increases in DS rsFC with executive function areas were associated with improved executive function, though each network exhibited some crossover in function. Collectively, these findings suggest that typical adolescent neurodevelopment is characterized by a divergence in ventral and dorsal frontostriatal connectivity that may relate to developmental improvements in affective decision-making and executive function. Significance Statement Anatomical studies in nonhuman primates demonstrate that frontostriatal circuits are essential for integration of neural functions underlying reward processing and cognition, with human neuroimaging studies linking alterations in these circuits to psychopathology. The present study characterized the developmental trajectories of frontostriatal resting state networks from childhood to young adulthood. We demonstrate that ventral and dorsal aspects of the striatum exhibit distinct age-related changes that predicted developmental improvements in reward-related decision making and executive function. These results highlight that adolescence is characterized by distinct changes in frontostriatal networks that may relate to normative increases in risk-taking. Atypical developmental trajectories of frontostriatal networks may contribute to adolescent-onset psychopathology.",10/03/2025,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience

This poses challenges to provide these agents at concentrations necessary to extinguish cell cycling in tumors. HR+ breast cancer cells are highly dependent on CDK4 but not CDK6. By contrast, CDK4 is dispensable for human bone marrow derived cells, due to the primary and compensatory role of CDK6 in hematopoiesis. This prompted us to develop atirmociclib (PF-07220060), a next-generation CDK4 selective inhibitor. Atirmociclib's impact on circulating neutrophils was reduced, in proportion with its increase in CDK4 versus CDK6 selectivity. Realized dose intensification led to greater CDK4 inhibition and deeper anti-tumor responses, pointing to CDK4 target coverage as a limiting factor of CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy. We also highlight combinatorial agents that may counter acquired resistance to CDK4 selective inhibition and widen its clinical application.",10/03/2025,Cancer cell
10.1088/1361-6560/aca3f8,Experimental feasibility of xenon-enhanced dual-energy radiography for imaging of lung function,"Fateen Basharat,Jesse Tanguay","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. We experimentally investigated the feasibility of two-dimensional xenon-enhanced dual-energy (XeDE) radiography for imaging of lung function. We optimized image quality under quantum-noise-limited conditions using a chest phantom consisting of a rectangular chamber representing the thoracic volume and PMMA slabs simulating x-ray attenuation by soft tissue. A sealed, air-filled cavity with thin PMMA walls was positioned inside the chamber to simulate a 2 cm thick ventilation defect. The chamber was ventilated with xenon and dual-energy imaging was performed using a diagnostic x-ray tube and a flat-panel detector. The contrast-to-noise ratio of ventilation defects normalized by patient x-ray exposure maximized at a kV-pair of approximately 60/140-kV and when approximately one third of the total exposure was allocated to the HE image. We used the optimized technique to image a second phantom that contained lung-parenchyma-mimicking PMMA clutter, rib-mimicking aluminum slats and an insert that simulated ventilation defects with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 cm to 2 cm and diameters ranging from 1 cm to 2 cm. From the resulting images we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the non-prewhitening model observer with an eye filter and internal noise. For a xenon concentration of 75%, good AUCs (i.e. 0.8-0.9) to excellent AUCs (i.e. >0.9) were obtained when the defect diameter is greater than 1.3 cm and defect thickness is 1 cm. When the xenon concentration was reduced to 50%, the AUC was ∼0.9 for defects 1.2 cm in diameter and ∼1.5 cm in thickness. Two-dimensional XeDE radiography may therefore enable detection of functional abnormalities associated with early-stage COPD, for which xenon ventilation defects can occupy up to 20% of the lung volume, and should be further developed as a low-cost alternative to MRI-based approaches and a low-dose alternative to CT-based approaches.",12/12/2022,Physics in medicine and biology

Gain or amplification of chromosome 1q (1q+) is the most frequent arm-level copy number gain in patients with MM and is associated with higher risk of progression and death despite recent therapeutic advances. Thus, developing targeted therapy for MM patients with 1q+ stands to benefit a large portion of patients in need of more effective management. Here, we employed large-scale dependency screens and drug screens to systematically characterize the therapeutic vulnerabilities of MM with 1q+ and displayed increased sensitivity to MCL1 and PI3K inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we compared subclones with and without 1q+ within the same patient tumors and demonstrated that 1q+ is associated with higher levels of MCL1 and the PI3K pathway. Furthermore, by isolating isogenic clones with different copy number profiles for part of the chromosome 1q arm, we observed increased sensitivity to MCL1 and PI3K inhibitors with arm-level gain. Lastly, we demonstrated synergy between MCL1 and PI3K inhibitors and dissected their mechanism of action in MM with 1q+, uncovering a cytostatic effect. In conclusion, this study highlights that MM with 1q+ may present enhanced sensitivity to MCL1 and PI3K inhibitors, enabling their use at lower doses without sacrificing efficacy, and may thus accelerate the development of targeted therapy for patients with MM and 1q+.",12/03/2025,Blood

Initially identified on histones, lysine lactylation has been also described on non-histone proteins, playing a pivotal role in transcriptional activation, protein function, and cellular processes. Two major sources of the lactyl moiety have been currently distinguished: L-lactyl-CoA (precursor of the L-lactyl moiety) and S-D-lactylglutathione (precursor of the D-lactyl moiety), which enable enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms of lysine lactylation, respectively. Although the specific writers, erasers, and readers of this modification are still unclear, acetyltransferases and deacetylases have been proposed as crucial mediators of lysine lactylation. Remarkably, lactylation exerts significant influence on critical cancer-related pathways, thereby shaping cellular behavior during malignant transformation and the metastatic cascade. Hence, as recent insights into lysine lactylation underscore its growing potential in tumor biology, targeting this modification is emerging as a significant opportunity for cancer treatment.",05/03/2025,Molecular cell

Many authors have hypothesized that albuminuria reflects widespread endothelial dysfunction, but additional work is needed to uncover whether albuminuria is directly pathologic or causative of cardiovascular disease. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio is an attractive, unifying biomarker of cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic conditions that may be useful for identifying and monitoring disease trajectory. However, albuminuria may develop through unique mechanisms across these distinct clinical phenotypes. This state-of-the-art review discusses the role of albuminuria in cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic conditions; identifies potential pathways linking albuminuria to adverse outcomes; and provides practical approaches to screening and managing albuminuria for clinical cardiologists. Future research is needed to determine how broadly and how frequently to screen patients for albuminuria, whether it is cost-effective to treat low-grade albuminuria (10-30 mg/g), and how to equitably offer newer antiproteinuric therapies across the spectrum of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic diseases.",11/03/2025,Circulation

While the role of MALT1 in promoting cancer cell proliferation has been investigated, its involvement in immune evasion is unclear. Here we report that MALT1 promotes immune evasion through its paracaspase and death domain. In a paracaspase-dependent manner, MALT1 protects CD274 mRNA from degradation by its cleavage of ROQUIN1 and ROQUIN2. In a death-domain-dependent manner, MALT1 promotes the proliferation and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages to generate an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Targeting MALT1 with antisense oligonucleotides inhibits PD-L1 expression in patient-derived tumor cells and suppresses the proliferation and M2-like polarization of tumor-associated macrophages isolated from patients with cancer. In preclinical models of solid tumors in female mice, treatment with MALT1 antisense oligonucleotides overcomes resistance to immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Together, our study demonstrates that targeting MALT1 is a potential strategy to overcome immune-checkpoint inhibitor resistance.",12/03/2025,Nature cancer

10.1111/jnc.70029,"The Glutamate/GABA-Glutamine Cycle: Insights, Updates, and Advances",Jens V Andersen,"Synaptic homeostasis of the principal neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is tightly regulated by an intricate metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes known as the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle. In this cycle, astrocytes take up glutamate and GABA from the synapse and convert these neurotransmitters into glutamine. Astrocytic glutamine is subsequently transferred to neurons, serving as the principal precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA synthesis. The glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle integrates multiple cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, uptake, synthesis, and metabolism. All of these processes are deeply interdependent and closely coupled to cellular energy metabolism. Astrocytes display highly active mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and several unique metabolic features, including glycogen storage and pyruvate carboxylation, which are essential to sustain continuous glutamine release. However, new roles of oligodendrocytes and microglia in neurotransmitter recycling are emerging. Malfunction of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle can lead to severe synaptic disruptions and may be implicated in several brain diseases. Here, I review central aspects and recent advances of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle to highlight how the cycle is functionally connected to critical brain functions and metabolism. First, an overview of glutamate, GABA, and glutamine transport is provided in relation to neurotransmitter recycling. Then, central metabolic aspects of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the critical metabolic roles of glial cells. Finally, I discuss how aberrant neurotransmitter recycling is linked to neurodegeneration and disease, focusing on astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and brain lipid homeostasis as emerging pathological mechanisms. Instead of viewing the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle as individual biochemical processes, a more holistic and integrative approach is needed to advance our understanding of how neurotransmitter recycling modulates brain function in both health and disease.",03/2025,Journal of neurochemistry

Here, we report that a p53-induced circular RNA circASCC3 promotes chemotherapeutic resistance by resolving R-loops. Our results reveal that p53 directly activates the transcription of ASCC3 , the host gene of circASCC3. In addition, the RNA-binding protein SFPQ is identified to inhibit the formation of circASCC3 by associating with its flanking regions. Importantly, p53 facilitates the formation of circASCC3 by repressing the expression of SFPQ. CircASCC3 has a marginal effect on the survival and growth of cancer cells under normal growing conditions but surprisingly boosts their survival and growth in response to DNA damage stress. Mechanistic analysis reveals that circASCC3 binds to the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 to inhibit its proteasomal degradation. This results in the prevention of R-loop accumulation due to DNA damage, thereby conferring tumor resistance to chemotherapy.

Yet, the mechanisms driving Aβ clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization.

Our findings delineate key mechanistic steps involving IP3R2 engagement and Ca 2+ flux, governing interleukin-25 (IL-25) production by tuft cells triggered by succinate detection. While IL-17RB has a pivotal intrinsic role in ILC2 activation, it exerts a regulatory function in tuft cells. Tuft cells exhibit constitutive Il25 expression, placing them in an anticipatory state that facilitates rapid production of IL-25 protein for ILC2 activation. Tuft cell IL-17RB is crucial for restraining IL-25 bioavailability, preventing excessive tonic ILC2 stimulation due to basal Il25 expression. Supraoptimal ILC2 stimulation by IL-25 resulting from tuft cell Il17rb deficiency or prolonged succinate exposure induces a state of hypoproliferation in ILC2s, also observed in chronic helminth infection.

In recent years, dietary supplements use has been the subject of increasing interest as a complementary strategy for the prevention and treatment of the disease. Materials and Methods : A Review of reviews was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and REAPPRAISED checklist to evaluate the efficacy and safety of supplement use in AD. The search, performed across major scientific databases, identified 54 relevant articles, including 53 reviews and one mini-review, after applying specific inclusion criteria and removing duplicates. Results : The growing body of evidence suggests that some supplements may help reduce cognitive decline, inflammation, and target mechanisms behind AD. However, many of these supplements are still under investigation, with mixed results highlighting the need for high-quality research. A key challenge is the lack of data on optimal dosages, administration duration, and long-term safety, which limits clinical guidelines. Some studies have reported positive effects from specific regimens, such as curcumin (800 mg/day), omega-3 fatty acids (2 g/day), and resveratrol (600 mg/day). Other supplements, like phosphatidylserine (300 mg/day), multinutrient formulations, probiotics, vitamin E (2000 IU/day), and melatonin (3-10 mg/day), also show benefits, though study variability makes conclusions uncertain.

Moreover, we find that establishing an IL-16-dependent, Th1-dominant TME relies on mast cell-produced histamine and results in the increased expression of the CXCR3 ligands in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thereby improving the therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Cancer patients exhibit impaired production of IL-16, which correlates with poorer prognosis. Additionally, low IL-16 production is associated with unresponsiveness to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Collectively, our findings provided new insights into the biological function of IL-16, emphasizing its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic approach to augment anti-tumor immunity and sensitize ICB-based cancer immunotherapy.",10/03/2025,Nature communications
10.1073/pnas.2417372122,DR5 is a restriction factor for human herpesviruses,"Chunyan Han,Chenwu Gui,Bingbing Su,Naizhang Liu,Haojie Yan,Ke Lan","Restriction factors are dominant proteins that target different essential steps of the viral life cycle; thus, these proteins provide an early line of defense against viruses. Here, we found that the internalization of DR5, an important receptor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, initiates apoptosis to inhibit Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication. An evolutionary analysis of the DR5 sequence demonstrated that three amino acids underwent positive selection in primates. Notably, one of these positive selection sites, A62, is essential for the antiviral function of DR5 and is important for the binding of DR5 to its ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, DR5 exhibits broad antiviral activity against and inhibits various herpesviruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and herpes simplex virus type 2. As a countermeasure, the KSHV K5 protein interacts with DR5 and promotes DR5 degradation through the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways; lysine 245 of DR5 is essential for K5-induced DR5 degradation. These findings demonstrate that DR5 is a restriction factor for human herpesviruses.",18/03/2025,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

In this study, we investigated water through cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on a highly solvated molecule, the Tetrahymena ribozyme, determined at 2.2 and 2.3 Å resolutions. By employing segmentation-guided water and ion modeling (SWIM) 17,18 , an approach combining resolvability and chemical parameters, we automatically modeled and cross-validated water molecules and Mg 2+ ions in the ribozyme core, revealing the extensive involvement of water in mediating RNA non-canonical interactions. Unexpectedly, in regions where SWIM does not model ordered water, we observed highly similar densities in both cryo-EM maps. In many of these regions, the cryo-EM densities superimpose with complex water networks predicted by molecular dynamics (MD), supporting their assignment as water and suggesting a biophysical explanation for their elusiveness to conventional atomic coordinate modeling. Our study demonstrates an approach to unveil both rigid and flexible waters that surround biomolecules through cryo-EM map densities, statistical and chemical metrics, and MD simulations.",11/03/2025,Nature

Here, we describe a generalizable selection method to enrich for GPCR ligands from a synthetic camelid antibody fragment (nanobody) library. Our strategy yielded multiple nanobody ligands for the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), a prototypical GPCR and important drug target. We found that nanobodies readily act as allosteric modulators, encoding selectivity for both the receptor and chemical features of GPCR ligands. We then used structure-guided design to convert two nanobodies from allosteric ligands to competitive AT1R inhibitors through simple mutations.

However, current dCas9-based activators are too large for efficient adeno-associated virus delivery, and the feasibility and durability of such treatments remain unclear. Here, we develop a muscle-targeted utrophin activation system using the compact dCasMINI-VPR system, termed MyoAAV-UA. Systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA in male mdx mice leads to substantial upregulation of utrophin at the sarcolemma, resulting in significant improvements in skeletal muscle function and a slowing of heart function deterioration. These benefits remain observable at six months post-treatment. In male nonhuman primates, systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA increases utrophin expression by twofold in skeletal muscle, with no significant side effects observed. Furthermore, MyoAAV-UA upregulates utrophin and utrophin-glycoprotein complexes in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myotubes from DMD patients.

Metabolically impaired obligate intracellular parasites, such as the human pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and Rickettsia prowazekii, can acquire ATP from their host cells through a unique ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) translocator, which mediates the import of ATP into and the export of ADP and phosphate out of the parasite cells, thus allowing the exploitation of the energy reserves of host cells (also known as energy parasitism). This type of ATP/ADP translocator also exists in the obligate intracellular endosymbionts of protists and the plastids of plants and algae and has been implicated to play an important role in endosymbiosis 3-31 . The plastid/parasite type of ATP/ADP translocator is phylogenetically and functionally distinct from the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator, and its structure and transport mechanism are still unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of two plastid/parasite types of ATP/ADP translocators in the apo and substrate-bound states. The ATP/ADP-binding pocket is located at the interface between the N and C domains of the translocator, and a conserved asparagine residue within the pocket is critical for substrate specificity. The translocator operates through a rocker-switch alternating access mechanism involving the relative rotation of the two domains as rigid bodies. Our results provide critical insights for understanding ATP translocation across membranes in energy parasitism and endosymbiosis and offer a structural basis for developing drugs against obligate intracellular parasites.",12/03/2025,Nature

However, most patients do not durably benefit, highlighting the need for biomarkers to stratify patients as responders or non-responders. While CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated with immune checkpoint therapy response, there is not a consensus on which CD8+ TIL subpopulations have the most prognostic value. Preclinical studies have focused on progenitor-like exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX), since TPEX proliferate more in response to PD-1 inhibitors than other exhausted T cell (TEX) subpopulations. However, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment drives TPEX differentiation into other TEX populations that can mediate anti-tumor immunity. These data complicate the ability to identify prognostically important T cell populations in patients that predict ICI treatment response. In this study, we found that advanced melanoma patients with ≥20% of CD8+ TILs co-expressing PD-1 and CTLA-4 (termed CPHi TILs) had better objective response rates and survival following PD-1 monotherapy than those below this threshold. Characterization of the CPHi TIL subset using bulk and single cell RNA sequencing showed that while TPEX-like cells were present within the CPHi subset, they were in the minority of these cells. Rather, the CPHi population was numerically dominated by other subsets, including cycling, terminally exhausted, cytotoxic-like, and/or resident memory-like TEX populations, and a subset enriched for glycolytic genes. Collectively, these data show that CPHi TILs correlate with response in melanoma, but this TIL subset is a heterogenous mix of different subpopulations that may differentially contribute to anti-tumor immunity following checkpoint blockade.",05/03/2025,Cancer research

However, the holistic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we show that KAT7 crotonylation, facilitated by the crotonyltransferase hMOF, competes against its acetylation regulated by the deacetylase HDAC2 at the K432 residue upon DNA damage stimulation. This competition diminishes its histone acetyltransferase activity, leading to the inhibition of procentriole formation in colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, the reduction of KAT7 histone acetyltransferase activity by the antagonistic effect of KAT7 crotonylation against its acetylation decreases the gene expression associated with procentriole formation by modulating the enrichment of H3K14ac at their promoters and plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis.

We conducted longitudinal multi-omics analyses in samples from CLL patients receiving ibrutinib upfront to identify potential adaptive mechanisms to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition during the first 12 months of continuous therapy. We found that ibrutinib induced a decrease in the expression of exhaustion markers and the proportion of Tregs and Tfh cells normalized to levels observed in healthy donors. Functionally, the expression of genes related to activation, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism were downregulated in T cells; after in vitro stimulation, proliferation capacity was only slightly modified by ibrutinib treatment, while cytokine production was increased. In CLL cells, we observed a downregulation of immunosuppression, adhesion, and migration proteins. Adaptation at molecular level, characterized by an increase in cancer cell fraction of CLL cells with mutated driver genes, was observed in around half of the patients and was associated with retained migrative capacity towards CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Interestingly, BTK C481S mutations were detected as early as after 6 months of treatment, particularly enriched in subsets of malignant cells retaining migrative capacity. These CLL cells with potential migrative capacity under ibrutinib also exhibited a distinct transcriptomic profile including upregulation of mTOR-AKT and MYC pathways. We identified the high expression of TMBIM6 as a potential novel independent poor prognostic factor. Of note, BIA, a TMBIM6 antagonist, induced CLL cell apoptosis and synergized with ibrutinib.

Risk of progression to disease is higher in the first years after infection, and in people with undernourishment, immunosuppression, or who smoke, drink alcohol, or have diabetes. Although cough, fever, and weight loss are hallmark symptoms, people with tuberculosis can be asymptomatic, so a high index of suspicion is required. Prompt diagnosis can be made by sputum examination (ideally with rapid molecular tests), but chest radiography can be helpful. Most people with disease can be treated with regimens of 6 months or less; longer regimens may be necessary for those with drug resistance. Central to successful treatment is comprehensive, person-centred care including addressing key determinants, such as undernourishment, smoking, and alcohol use, and optimising management of comorbidities, such as diabetes and HIV.

This inefficiency stems primarily from decreased vector uptake by the liver rather than loss of vector genomes due to hepatocyte turnover. Additionally, fibrosis alters blood vector clearance and redistributes AAV particles to extra-hepatic organs, such as spleen, lung, and kidney. At the cellular level, fibrosis decreases AAV genome content in hepatocytes while increasing it in non-parenchymal liver cells and splenic immune cells.

Meanwhile, treatment with the GSDMD inhibitor necrosulfonamide alleviated CIHL in these mice. To further examine the role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in CIHL, we conducted experiments in Gsdmd- deficient mice . Gsdmd -/- mice demonstrated significantly lower cisplatin-induced cochlear damage than control mice and appeared to be invulnerable to CIHL. Furthermore, GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in the stria vascularis (SV), but not in the hair cells (HCs), played a dominant role in CIHL. In marginal cells (MCs) of SV, cisplatin induced caspase-dependent GSDMD cleavage, and the pore-forming N-terminal of GSDMD rapidly localized to the mitochondria, leading to abnormal mitochondrial aggregation and oxidative stress. The consequent mitochondrial dysfunction in MCs might result in the severe progression of inflammation, SV damage, and HC loss.

Evidence mounted in recent years indicated development of social cognitions was more susceptible to general anesthesia in early life. However, the behavioral characterization during adolescence and underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Herein, we observed that early postnatal S-ketamine exposure specifically induced deficits in sociability and social cognition via a machine learning assistant behavioral analysis toolbox- Social Behavioral Atlas (SBeA). Furthermore, S-ketamine exposure constantly activates microglia in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), mediating excessive synaptic pruning and dendritic structural abnormalities, leading to overexcitation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Notably, S-ketamine exposure activated Stat1-Arg1 pathway in microglia. Downregulating Arg1 expression or prophylactic administrating Arg1 selective inhibitor nor-NOHA could reverse microglial overactivation and attenuate the neurodevelopmental disturbance induced by S-ketamine exposure. Our study identifies the abnormal behavioral phenotypes in adolescence induced by early postnatal S-ketamine exposure and reveals a potential target for preventing anesthesia-related neurodevelopmental abnormalities.",11/03/2025,Molecular psychiatry

Both EBV and Plasmodium falciparum malaria are cofactors in the etiology of BL. However, how these 2 pathogens drive BL pathogenesis is not yet understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that P. falciparum and EBV synergize to induce dysregulated expression of AID. Using flow cytometry, intracellular AID expression was measured in PBMCs from a cohort of children from Western Kenya with uncomplicated malaria and community controls. Children with uncomplicated malaria had elevated levels of CD19+ AID+ B cells compared to controls. This high level of AID was sustained up to 8 weeks after parasite clearance. Using ImageStream flow cytometry, we found that 52% of AID was localized in the nucleus of CD19+ B cells in children with malaria. To test whether EBV and P. falciparum synergized to drive the expression of AID, we stimulated CD19+ B cells with EBV, CpG (to mimic P. falciparum DNA), or BAFF (induced during P. falciparum infection), or as a combination. Individually, EBV, BAFF and CpG induced AID expression. However, when combined, there was a significant increase of ∼30% in the frequency of CD19+AID+ cells above cells treated with EBV, BAFF, or CpG individually. Collectively, these data suggest that P. falciparum malaria and EBV coinfection result in sustained AID expression, potentially influencing the MYC translocation that is characteristic of BL.",14/03/2025,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)"

However, the genetic basis underlying the NDV thermostability is poorly understood. In this study, we generated chimeric viruses by exchanging viral genes between the thermostable TS09-C strain and thermolabile LaSota strain using reverse genetics technology. Evaluations of these chimeric NDVs demonstrated that the thermostability of NDV was dependent on the origin of HN protein. Chimeras bearing the HN protein derived from thermostable virus exhibited a thermostable phenotype, and vice versa. Both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities of viruses bearing the TS09-C HN protein were more thermostable than those containing LaSota HN protein. Furthermore, the newly developed thermostable virus rLS-T-HN, encoding the TS09-C HN protein in LaSota backbone, induced significantly higher antibody response than the TS09-C virus, and conferred complete protection against virulent NDV challenge. Taken together, the data suggest that the HN protein of NDV is a crucial determinant of thermostability, and the HN gene from a thermostable NDV could be engineered into a thermolabile NDV vaccine strain for developing novel thermostable NDV vaccine.",03/03/2016,Scientific reports

We apply computational methods to analyze ecDNA from whole-genome sequencing data of 595 urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients. We demonstrate that ecDNA drives clonal evolution through structural rearrangements during malignant transformation and recurrence of UC. This supports a model wherein tumors evolve via the selective expansion of ecDNA-bearing cells. Through multi-regional sampling of tumors, we demonstrate that ecDNA contributes to the evolution of multifocality and increased intratumoral heterogeneity. EcDNA is present in 36% of UC tumors and correlates with an immunosuppressive phenotype and poor prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses reveal that ecDNA+ malignant cells exhibit diminished expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, enabling them to evade T-cell immunity.

Tissue-specific splice variants (SVs) of human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are catalytic nulls thought to confer regulatory functions. One example from human histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS), termed HARS WHEP because the splicing event resulted in a protein encompassing the WHEP-TRS domain of HARS (a structurally conserved domain found in multiple aaRSs), is enriched in human lung and up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines in lung and immune cells. Structural analysis of HARS WHEP confirmed a well-organized helix-turn-helix motif. This motif bound specifically and selectively to neuropilin-2 (NRP2), a receptor expressed by myeloid cells in active sites of inflammation, to inhibit expression of proinflammatory receptors and cytokines and to down-regulate inflammatory pathways in primary human macrophages. In animal models of lung injury and ILD, including bleomycin treatment, silicosis, sarcoidosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis-ILD, HARS WHEP reduced lung inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and fibrosis. In patients with sarcoidosis, efzofitimod treatment resulted in down-regulation of gene expression for inflammatory pathways in peripheral immune cells and stabilization of inflammatory biomarkers in serum after steroid tapering. We demonstrate the immunomodulatory activity of HARS WHEP and present preclinical data supporting ongoing clinical development of the biologic efzofitimod based on HARS WHEP in ILD.",12/03/2025,Science translational medicine

The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood. We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly.

Metastasizing cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, as they are initially deprived of the immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours 3 . There is interest in therapeutically exploiting this immune vulnerability to prevent recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of metastasis. Here we show that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), including aspirin, enhance immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 acts on T cells to trigger an immunosuppressive pathway that is dependent on the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA 2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner that is dependent on T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA 2 in vivo. These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway that limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",05/03/2025,Nature

The substrate concentration dependencies of the initial rate for the synthesis with the immobilized enzyme in ethyl acetate were quite different from those in aqueous buffer with the free enzyme, but similar to those measured in the biphasic system or in ethyl acetate containing a small amount of water. Therefore, it was considered that as a first approximation the reaction in the water-immiscible organic solvent with the immobilized enzyme could be treated by the aqueous/organic biphasic reaction. Based on this consideration, the optimum reaction condition for the reaction with the immobilized enzyme in ethyl acetate for the synthesis of Z-AspPheOMe could be estimated.",1991,Biomedica biochimica acta

Despite its known association, the specific mechanisms, particularly those involving EBV-induced histone modifications, remain poorly understood. Through integrative analyses of single-cell and bulk transcriptome data from epithelial tumor tissues and EBV-infected cells, we identified KDM5B as a critical histone-modifying factor consistently upregulated following EBV infection. We demonstrated that EBV stimulates KDM5B expression via interactions of its latent gene EBNA1 with transcription factor CEBPB and through direct binding of its lytic gene BZLF1 to Zta-response elements on the KDM5B promoter. Functional assays revealed that KDM5B acts as an oncogene, correlating with poor survival outcomes in EBV-associated epithelial cancers. Mechanistically, KDM5B inhibited the tumor suppressor gene PLK2 through histone demethylation, thereby activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and promoting malignant progression. Furthermore, treatment with the KDM5B inhibitor AS-8351 markedly attenuated this signaling activity and exhibited strong anti-tumor effect in both in vitro and in vivo patient-derived xenograft models from EBV-associated tumors. Together, these findings provide novel insights into how EBV hijacks KDM5B to mediate histone demethylation of PLK2, facilitating tumor progression through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in epithelial cancers, highlighting promising therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic alterations in EBV-associated cancers.",10/03/2025,Signal transduction and targeted therapy

Immune dysregulation, mediated through both immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent and IgE-independent pathways, plays a pivotal role in CU pathogenesis, involving key effector cells such as mast cells (MCs), basophils, and eosinophils. This dysregulation culminates in the release of histamine, prostaglandins, and other mediators, which precipitate pruritus. The chronicity of the disease leads to sustained pruritic symptoms, contributing to both central and peripheral sensitization. The excitation of the itch circuit is augmented, leading to the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which subsequently interact with immune cells. Psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, and stress exacerbate CU symptoms and diminish quality of life. These factors disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Furthermore, the act of scratching activates the reward circuit, resulting in the manifestation of the itch-scratching cycle. Current treatments, such as antihistamines, omalizumab, and cyclosporine, demonstrate variable efficacy and are often associated with adverse effects. A holistic approach addressing both psychological and physiological aspects is advocated. This review highlights the critical importance of understanding neuroimmune interactions and the influence of psychosomatic factors in CU.

Using data from TCGA, GTEx, and Ualcan databases, we investigated the relationship of RPN1 with prognosis, genomic alterations, and epigenetic modifications across various cancers. Differential analysis revealed elevated RPN1 expression in multiple cancer types, indicating a potential prognostic value. Amplification was the predominant mutation type of RPN1 in pan-cancer, with notable correlations with DNA methylation and copy number variation. Gene set variation analysis identified RPN1's involvement in cancer development, immunity, and metabolism. Additionally, RPN1 expression correlated with the tumor microenvironment, immune response factors, and response to anti-tumor therapies. Functional validation in triple-negative breast cancer, glioblastoma, and bladder cancer cell lines demonstrated the role of RPN1 in tumor cell proliferation and migration.

10.1177/00220345251315723,Role of Pink1 in Regulating Osteoclast Differentiation during Periodontitis,"H Gou,T Wang,Y Chen,Y Zhou,J Li,Y Xu","Periodontitis has recently been recognized as an inflammatory disease caused by oxidative stress, with mitochondrial dysfunction being a key factor leading to oxidative stress. PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is an essential protein for mitochondrial quality control, which protects cells from oxidative stress by inducing mitophagy to degrade damaged mitochondria, but its role in periodontitis has not been elucidated. This study aimed to explore the contribution and underlying mechanisms of Pink1 in regulating the differentiation and function of osteoclasts during periodontitis. Here we observed a significant downregulation of PINK1 expression in periodontitis-affected tissues. Then we constructed a periodontitis model in mice with fluorescently labeled mononuclear/macrophages, and the results showed that as the modeling time extended, the alveolar bone destruction gradually worsened and was accompanied by gradually decreased Pink1 expression in osteoclasts and a significantly increased osteoclast number. In vitro experiments further demonstrated a negative correlation between Pink1 and osteoclast differentiation. In addition, alveolar bone destruction in the Pink1 knockout mice was significantly more advanced than that in the littermate wild type mice after ligature-induced periodontitis and enhanced osteoclastogenesis and bone-resorptive capacity in vitro. RNA-sequencing analysis and in vitro validation revealed that the absence of Pink1 led to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation levels and an enhancement of calcium-mediated signaling, specifically the calcineurin-NFATc1 pathway, via an intracellular calcium source. Further mechanistic studies found that the deficiency of Pink1 inhibited mitophagy but strengthened mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum coupling, which, by promoting the interaction of Mfn2-IP3R-VDAC1 proteins, increased the concentration of mitochondrial calcium ions, thereby triggering more active osteoclast differentiation. The aforementioned process can be reversed by the IP3R channel inhibitor Bcl-XL. These findings unveiled that Pink1 was involved in osteoclast differentiation by regulating mitochondrial calcium transport mediated by mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes, providing a new theoretical basis for the pathogenesis and treatment of periodontitis.",12/03/2025,Journal of dental research

The NLRP3 inflammasome is an important intracellular multiprotein complex composed of the innate immune receptor NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC, and the protease caspase-1. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can induce pyroptosis and the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, thus playing a central role in immune and inflammatory responses. Recent studies have revealed that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in the brain to induce neuroinflammation, leading to further neuronal damage and functional impairment, and contributes to the pathological process of various neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke.

More than 80% of patients with PC present with advanced-stage disease, preventing potentially curative surgery. The neuropeptide Y (NPY) system, best known for its role in controlling energy homeostasis, has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis in a range of cancer types, but its role in PC has yet to be explored. We show that expression of NPY and NPY1R are up-regulated in mouse PC models and human patients with PC. Moreover, using the genetically engineered, autochthonous KP R172H C mouse model of PC, we demonstrate that pancreas-specific and whole-body knockout of Npy1r significantly decreases metastasis to the liver. We identify that treatment with the NPY1R antagonist BIBO3304 significantly reduces KP R172H C migratory capacity on cell-derived matrices.

Using high-dimensional CO-detection by indexing, a technology for spatial imaging, this study examines the cellular microenvironment of MS lesions in secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. We analyzed immune, glial, neuronal, and endothelial cell interactions within MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter across two independent cohorts. Our findings show the enrichment of EBV markers, particularly EBNA1 and LMP1, within MS lesions. EBV-positive cells interact closely with reactive astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Image analysis confirmed the presence of EBV-positive staining within neurons and glial cells, suggesting a direct role for EBV in neuronal and glial involvement in MS. Additionally, we observed altered immune cell interactions, including reduced associations with macrophages and memory T cells, and enhanced interactions with glial cells. Disruptions in blood-brain barrier integrity were also noted in regions of the MS brain.

However, previous studies on intratumoral microbiota primarily rely on bulk tissue analysis, which may obscure their spatial distribution and localized effects. In this study, we applied in situ spatial-profiling technology to investigate the spatial distribution of intratumoral microbiota in breast cancer and their interactions with the local TME. Using 5R 16S rRNA gene sequencing and RNAscope FISH/CISH on patients' tissue, we identified significant spatial heterogeneity in intratumoral microbiota, with Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) predominantly localized in tumour cell-rich areas. GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP) revealed that regions colonized by F. nucleatum exhibit significant influence on the expression of RNAs and proteins involved in proliferation, migration and invasion. In vitro studies indicated that co-culture with F. nucleatum significantly stimulates the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Integrative spatial multi-omics and co-culture transcriptomic analyses highlighted the MAPK signalling pathways as key altered pathways. By intersecting these datasets, VEGFD and PAK1 emerged as critical upregulated proteins in F. nucleatum-positive regions, showing strong positive correlations with MAPK pathway proteins. Moreover, the upregulation of VEGFD and PAK1 by F. nucleatum was confirmed in co-culture experiments, and their knockdown significantly reduced F. nucleatum-induced proliferation and migration. In conclusion, intratumoral microbiota in breast cancer exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity, with F. nucleatum colonization markedly altering tumour cell protein expression to promote progression and migration. These findings provide novel perspectives on the role of microbiota in breast cancer, identify potential therapeutic targets, and lay the foundation for future cancer treatments. KEY POINTS: Intratumoral Fusobacterium nucleatum exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity within breast cancer tissues. F. nucleatum colonization alters the expression of key proteins involved in tumour progression and migration.

Tebentafusp, an immune-mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptor against cancer (ImmTAC), is a therapeutic shown to improve overall survival (OS) in HLA-A*02:01 + adult patients with mUM. Here we investigate the impact of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) on ImmTAC activity. In vitro, M2 macrophages inhibit ImmTAC-mediated tumor-killing in a dose-dependent and contact-dependent manner. Accordingly, high baseline intratumoral TAM-to-T cell ratios correlate with shorter OS (HR = 2.09, 95% CI, 1.31-3.33, p = 0.002) in tebentafusp-treated mUM patients from a phase 2 trial. By contrast, IL-2 conditioning of T cells overcomes M2 macrophage-mediated suppression in vitro, while ImmTAC treatment leads to M2-to-M1 macrophage reprogramming both in vitro and in tebentafusp-treated mUM patients. Overall, we show that tebentafusp reshapes the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-tumor T cell activity, whilst combining tebentafusp with IL-2 may enhance benefit in patients with high levels of TAM.",10/03/2025,Nature communications

In this study, we constructed an animal model using anti-NMDAR IgG purified from the serum of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and we used IgG obtained from healthy individuals as a control. Daily administration of anti-NMDAR IgG into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice for 7 days resulted in cognitive impairments resembling clinical symptoms, which spontaneously resolved 30 days after discontinuing the injections. Immunohistochemical staining and electrophysiological testing of parvalbumin neurons in the mPFC treated with anti-NMDAR IgG revealed significant cellular morphological damage, reduced excitability, synaptic dysfunction and a loss of NMDAR antagonist-induced gamma oscillations. Application of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic techniques to activate parvalbumin neurons in the mPFC successfully reversed the cognitive impairments observed in the anti-NMDAR-IgG-treated mice. Single-cell sequencing of anti-NMDAR-IgG-treated parvalbumin neurons identified differentially expressed genes and pathways related to synapses and neuronal development, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, we showed that these alterations in parvalbumin neurons were not confined to the mPFC, as similar changes were detected in the hippocampus after anti-NMDAR IgG injections. In summary, our findings elucidate distinct alterations in parvalbumin neurons during the pathogenesis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, providing preclinical rationale for exploring approaches to modulate parvalbumin neuronal function to treat anti-NMDAR encephalitis.",12/03/2025,Brain : a journal of neurology

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1548979,In-depth analysis of the safety of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors,"Jiayi Dong,Jiexiong Wu,Ye Jin,Zhu Zheng,Ting Su,Lijuan Shao,Jiaxin Bei,Size Chen","In recent years, the rapid progress in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology has dramatically advanced cancer immunotherapy, particularly CAR-T cell therapy. This innovative approach involves engineering a patient's T cells to express receptors that specifically target tumor antigens, enhancing their ability to identify and eliminate cancer cells. However, the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors is often hampered by the challenging tumor microenvironment (TME). The complex TME includes dense stroma that obstructs T cell infiltration, abnormal blood vessel structures leading to hypoxia, and an acidic pH, all of which hinder CAR-T cell function. Additionally, the presence of immunosuppressive factors in the TME reduces the efficacy of CAR-T cells, making successful targeting of tumors more difficult. The safety of CAR-T therapy has gained interest, especially CAR-T therapy has shown considerable effectiveness in various cancers, with notable results in multiple myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. Nonetheless, CAR-T cell therapy is associated with several adverse reactions primarily driven by heightened levels of proinflammatory cytokines. These reactions include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (CANS), and organ toxicity, often leading to serious complications. CRS, characterized by systemic inflammation due to cytokine release, can escalate to severe organ dysfunction. It typically occurs within the first week post-infusion, correlating with CAR-T cell expansion and often presents with fever and hypotension. Meanwhile, CANS encompasses neurological issues ranging from mild symptoms to severe seizures, possibly exacerbated by CRS. Organ toxicity can also arise from CAR-T therapy, with potential damage affecting the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, and lungs, often tied to shared antigens found in both tumor and healthy tissues. Moreover, long-term effects like cytokine-associated hematotoxicity (CAHT) and secondary malignancies represent significant concerns that could affect the patient's quality of life post-treatment. The long-term adverse effects and challenges in treating solid tumors underscore the need for ongoing research. Strategies to improve CAR-T cell efficacy, minimize adverse reactions, and enhance patient safety are critical. Future explorations could include designing CAR-T cells to better navigate the TME, identifying specific target antigen profiles to minimize off-target damage, and developing adjunct therapies to mitigate cytokine-related toxicity. Continued monitoring for long-term effects will also be paramount in improving patient outcomes and maintaining their quality of life. Overall, while CAR-T therapy holds great promise, it must be administered with careful consideration of potential side effects and rigorous management strategies to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy.",24/02/2025,Frontiers in immunology

Lactate, traditionally viewed as a byproduct of glycolysis with limited ATP-producing capacity, has recently gained recognition as a critical signaling molecule. It plays a key role not only in cancer cell metabolism but also in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME). Histone lysine lactylation, a newly identified post-translational modification, has been shown to influence a range of cellular processes in cancer. Current research focuses on the mechanisms and functions of histone lactylation in cancer, including its role in gene expression regulation, signal transduction, and protein synthesis. However, despite these advancements, there are still plenty of barriers in the quest to unravel the mechanisms of lactylation modification. The emergence of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics may offer valuable insights for selecting targets. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the mechanisms and the applications of lactylation modification in clinical settings. Through a detailed analysis, we identify the key challenges and limitations that exist in the current research landscape. These insights lay the groundwork for future studies by highlighting promising research directions.",08/03/2025,Experimental hematology & oncology

It has long been hypothesized, motivated by observations in artificial learning experiments, that dopamine has a crucial role in this process. Dopamine in the basal ganglia is thought to guide reward-based trial-and-error learning by encoding reward prediction errors 1 , decreasing after worse-than-predicted reward outcomes and increasing after better-than-predicted ones. Our previous work in adult zebra finches-in which we changed the perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback-showed that dopamine in Area X, the singing-related basal ganglia, encodes performance prediction error: dopamine is suppressed after worse-than-predicted (distorted syllables) and activated after better-than-predicted (undistorted syllables) performance 2 . However, it remains unknown whether the learning of natural behaviours, such as developmental vocal learning, occurs through dopamine-based reinforcement. Here we tracked song learning trajectories in juvenile zebra finches and used fibre photometry 3 to monitor concurrent dopamine activity in Area X. We found that dopamine was activated after syllable renditions that were closer to the eventual adult version of the song, compared with recent renditions, and suppressed after renditions that were further away. Furthermore, the relationship between dopamine and song fluctuations revealed that dopamine predicted the future evolution of song, suggesting that dopamine drives behaviour. Finally, dopamine activity was explained by the contrast between the quality of the current rendition and the recent history of renditions-consistent with dopamine's hypothesized role in encoding prediction errors in an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model 4,5 . Reinforcement-learning algorithms 6 have emerged as a powerful class of model to explain learning in reward-based laboratory tasks, as well as for driving autonomous learning in artificial intelligence 7 . Our results suggest that complex natural behaviours in biological systems can also be acquired through dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning.",12/03/2025,Nature

Neutrophil heterogeneity analysis characterized transcriptional states linked to age and cancer stage. Integrating ligand-receptor and PIC sequencing analyses with various functional experiments unveiled a physical and secreted protumorigenic signaling niche. This approach revealed that neutrophils are recruited by tumor-activated macrophages and physically interact with tumor cells, increasing tumor cell proliferative and invasive properties, as well as endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. The molecular program upregulated in neutrophil-PICs correlates with lower survival in advanced breast cancer patients.

10.1111/dom.16263,An overview of obesity-related complications: The epidemiological evidence linking body weight and other markers of obesity to adverse health outcomes,Matthias Blüher,"Obesity is a highly prevalent chronic multisystem disease associated with shortened life expectancy due to a number of adverse health outcomes. Epidemiological data link body weight and parameters of central fat distribution to an increasing risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, obstructive sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis, mental disorders and some types of cancer. However, the individual risk to develop cardiometabolic and other obesity-related diseases cannot entirely be explained by increased fat mass. Rather than excess fat accumulation, dysfunction of adipose tissue may represent the mechanistic link between obesity and adverse health outcomes. There are people living with obesity who seem to be protected against the premature development of cardiometabolic diseases. On the other hand, people with normal weight may develop typical obesity diseases upon dysfunction of adipose tissue and predominantly visceral fat distribution. The mechanisms linking impaired function of adipose tissue in people with obesity include adipocyte hypertrophy, altered cellular composition, limited expandability of safe subcutaneous fat stores, ectopic fat deposition in visceral depots, the liver and other organs, hypoxia, a variety of stresses, inflammatory processes, and the release of pro-inflammatory, diabetogenic and atherogenic signals. Genetic and environmental factors might contribute either alone or via interaction with intrinsic biological factors to variation in adipose tissue function. There are still many open questions regarding the mechanisms of how increased body weight causes obesity-related disorders and whether these pathologies could be reversed. Evidence-based weight loss interventions using behaviour change, pharmacological or surgical approaches have clarified the beneficial effects of realistic and sustained weight loss on obesity-related complications as hard outcomes. This review focusses on recent advances in understanding epidemiological trends and mechanisms of obesity-related diseases. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Obesity is a chronic complex and progressive disease characterized by excessive fat deposition that may impair health and quality of life. Worldwide, the number of adults living with obesity has more than doubled since 1990. Obesity may lead to reduced life expectancy, because it increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, stroke), fatty liver diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, depression and certain types of cancer. However, not every person with obesity develops these diseases. For better prevention and treatment, it is important to understand the mechanisms linking high fat mass to obesity related diseases. It has become clear that fat mass alone cannot explain the higher risk of obesity complications. People with obesity can have either high or low risk of developing complications. Compared to people with a low risk for obesity complications those with a high risk to develop obesity related diseases are characterized by higher central fat deposition in the abdominal region, on average bigger fat cells, higher number of immune cells in adipose tissue and altered signals released from adipose tissue that may directly affect the brain, liver, vasculature and other organs. Both inherited and environment factors may cause these abnormalities of adipose tissue function. However, weight loss through behaviour changes (e.g., lower calorie intake, higher physical activity), medications or obesity surgery can improve health, quality of life and reduce the risk for obesity related diseases.",11/03/2025,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism"

Previous research implicated maternal care as a key mediator of behavioral responses to the adversity in adolescence, but details of molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show social stress activates transcription factor C/EBPβ in mPFC neurons of adolescent mice, which transcriptionally upregulates Dnm1l and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby conferring stress susceptibility in adolescent mice. Moreover, different maternal separation differentially regulates adolescent stress susceptibility. Mechanistically, this differential effect depends on maternal behavior-stimulated IGF-1, which inhibits neuronal C/EBPβ through mTORC1-induced C/EBPβ-LIP translation. Furthermore, we identify maternal behavior-stimulated IGF-1 is mainly released from mPFC microglia. Notably, increased maternal care under an environmental enrichment condition or maternal behavior impairment induced by repeated MPOA Esr1+ cells inhibition in dams prevents or promotes stress susceptibility via microglial-to-neuronal IGF-1-C/EBPβ-DRP1 signaling. In this work, these findings have unveiled molecular mechanisms by which maternal behavior promotes stress resilience in adolescents.",08/03/2025,Nature communications

Here, through integrating single-cell RNA sequencing with long-term live-cell imaging of the Arabidopsis root, we reveal that brassinosteroid activity fluctuates throughout the cell cycle, decreasing during mitotic divisions and increasing during the G1 phase. The post-mitotic recovery of brassinosteroid activity is driven by the intrinsic polarity of the mother cell, resulting in one daughter cell with enhanced brassinosteroid signaling, while the other supports brassinosteroid biosynthesis. The coexistence of these distinct daughter cell states during the G1 phase circumvents a negative feedback loop to facilitate brassinosteroid production while signaling increases. Our findings uncover polarity-guided, uneven mitotic divisions in the meristem, which control brassinosteroid hormone activity to ensure optimal root growth.",06/03/2025,Cell

However, the interplay between microRNAs (miRNAs) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modulation in regulating this balance remains poorly understood. Here, a significant reduction in miR-31-5p levels is observed in the lacrimal glands of rabbit autoimmune dacryoadenitis and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) dry eye patients. Overexpression of miR-31-5p exhibits preventive and therapeutic effects on rabbit autoimmune dacryoadenitis. Further investigation revealed that miR-31-5p overexpression significantly restored the M1/M2 macrophage balance both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, miR-31-5p directly targets the P2x7 receptor (P2RX7), leading to the inactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling and reduced expression of M1 markers. Furthermore, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)-mediated m6A demethylation, which sustains pri-miR-31 stability, is responsible for the decreased miR-31-5p levels in autoimmune dry eye. Notably, PBMC samples from SS dry eye patients further support the link between reduced miR-31-5p levels and M1 macrophage activation observed in rabbits. Overall, these data highlight the critical role of the FTO/miR-31-5p/P2RX7/p38 MAPK axis in autoimmune inflammation, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets for autoimmune dry eye.",11/03/2025,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"

A similar molecular lesion has also been observed in 80% of brains from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) compared to age-matched controls. However the precise site and mode of action of Hg ions remain illusive. Therefore, the present study examined whether Hg ions could affect membrane dynamics of neurite growth cone morphology and behavior. Since tubulin is a highly conserved cytoskeletal protein in both vertebrates and invertebrates, we hypothesized that growth cones from animal species could be highly susceptible to Hg ions. To test this possibility, the identified, large Pedal A (PeA) neurons from the central ring ganglia of the snail Lymnoea stagnalis were cultured for 48 h in 2 ml brain conditioned medium (CM). Following neurite outgrowth, metal chloride solution (2 microl) of Hg, Al, Pb, Cd, or Mn (10(-7) M) was pressure applied directly onto individual growth cones. Time-lapse images with inverted microscopy were acquired prior to, during, and after the metal ion exposure. We demonstrate that Hg ions markedly disrupted membrane structure and linear growth rates of imaged neurites in 77% of all nerve growth cones. When growth cones were stained with antibodies specific for both tubulin and actin, it was the tubulin/microtubule structure that disintegrated following Hg exposure. Moreover, some denuded neurites were also observed to form neurofibrillary aggregates. In contrast, growth cone exposure to other metal ions did not effect growth cone morphology, nor was their motility rate compromised. To determine the growth suppressive effects of Hg ions on neuronal sprouting, cells were cultured either in the presence or absence of Hg ions. We found that in the presence of Hg ions, neuronal somata failed to sprout, whereas other metalic ions did not effect growth patterns of cultured PeA cells. We conclude that this visual evidence and previous biochemical data strongly implicate Hg as a potential etiological factor in neurodegeneration.",26/03/2001,Neuroreport

Here we present most of the midface of a hominin found at the TE7 level of the Sima del Elefante site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain), dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago.

To investigate the metabolic regulation of radiation response, we conducted a comprehensive, metabolic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen using radiation as selection pressure in human non-small cell lung cancer. Lipoylation emerged as a key metabolic target for radiosensitization, with lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) identified as a top hit. LIPT1 covalently conjugates mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases with lipoic acid, facilitating enzymatic functions involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibiting lipoylation, either through genetic LIPT1 knockout or a lipoylation inhibitor (CPI-613), enhanced tumor control by radiation. Mechanistically, lipoylation inhibition increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to H3K9 trimethylation, disrupting TIP60 recruitment and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated DNA damage repair signaling, impairing homologous recombination repair.

10.3390/cells14050347,Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Stem Cell's Perspective,"Belén Calvo,Pierre Schembri-Wismayer,María Beatriz Durán-Alonso","Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a number of very heterogeneous disorders, primarily characterized by neuronal loss and a concomitant decline in neurological function. Examples of this type of clinical condition are Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Age has been identified as a major risk in the etiology of these disorders, which explains their increased incidence in developed countries. Unfortunately, despite continued and intensive efforts, no cure has yet been found for any of these diseases; reliable markers that allow for an early diagnosis of the disease and the identification of key molecular events leading to disease onset and progression are lacking. Altered adult neurogenesis appears to precede the appearance of severe symptoms. Given the scarcity of human samples and the considerable differences with model species, increasingly complex human stem-cell-based models are being developed. These are shedding light on the molecular alterations that contribute to disease development, facilitating the identification of new clinical targets and providing a screening platform for the testing of candidate drugs.

This perspective discusses the persistent issue of correlational studies in microbiome research and proposes an iterative method leveraging in silico, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies toward successful preclinical and clinical trials. The evolution of research methodologies, including the shift from small cohort studies to large-scale, multi-cohort, and even ""meta-cohort"" analyses, has been facilitated by advancements in sequencing technologies, providing researchers with tools to examine multiple health phenotypes within a single study. The integration of multi-omics approaches-such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics-provides a comprehensive understanding of host-microbe interactions and serves as a robust hypothesis generator for downstream in vitro and in vivo research. These hypotheses must then be rigorously tested, first with proof-of-concept experiments to clarify the causative effects of the microbiota, and then with the goal of deep mechanistic understanding.

10.1126/sciadv.adr5448,Phagocytosis-driven neurodegeneration through opposing roles of an ABC transporter in neurons and phagocytes,"Xinchen Chen,Bei Wang,Ankita Sarkar,Zixian Huang,Nicolas Vergara Ruiz,Ann T Yeung,Rachael Chen,Chun Han","Lipid homeostasis is critical to neuronal survival. ATP-binding cassette A (ABCA) proteins are lipid transporters associated with neurodegenerative diseases. How ABCA transporters regulate lipid homeostasis in neurodegeneration is an outstanding question. Here we report that the Drosophila ABCA protein engulfment ABC transporter in the ovary (Eato) regulates phagocytosis-dependent neurodegeneration by playing opposing roles in neurons and phagocytes: In neurons, Eato prevents dendrites and axons from being attacked by neighboring phagocytes; in phagocytes, Eato sensitizes the cell for detecting neurons as engulfment targets. Thus, Eato deficiency in neurons alone causes phagocytosis-dependent neurite degeneration, but additional Eato loss from phagocytes suppresses the neurite degeneration. Mechanistically, Eato functions by removing the eat-me signal phosphatidylserine from the cell surface in both neurons and phagocytes. Multiple human and worm ABCA homologs can rescue Eato loss in phagocytes but not in neurons, suggesting both conserved and cell type-specific activities of ABCA proteins. These results imply possible mechanisms of neuron-phagocyte interactions in neurodegenerative diseases.",14/03/2025,Science advances

Upon pathway initiation, generating the precise levels of the activator form of GLI depends on its concentration at the cilium tip. The mechanisms underlying this critical step in Hh signaling are unclear. We developed an assay to visualize GLI2, the primary GLI activator isoform, at single-particle resolution within the cilium. We found that GLI2 is a cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Anterograde-biased IFT loading of GLI2 in a restricted time window following pathway activation results in the tip accumulation of GLI2. Unexpectedly, we found that the conserved Hh regulator KIF7, a nonmotile kinesin, is important for the temporal control of IFT-mediated GLI2 transport and retention of GLI2 at the cilium tip. Our findings underscore a design principle where a cilia-specific cytoskeletal transport system and an Hh pathway-specific cytoskeletal protein collaboratively regulate GLI2 trafficking for Hh signaling.",14/03/2025,Science advances

Thus, we investigated immune responses to dying tumor cells after therapy in the tumor draining lymph node (TDLN). A key population responsible for clearing tumor material in the TDLN was medullary sinus macrophages (MSMs). Tumor debris phagocytosis by MSMs induces the cytokine IL-33, and blocking the IL-33 receptor (ST2) or deletion of Il33 in MSMs enhances therapy responses. Mechanistically, IL-33 activates T regulatory cells in TDLNs that migrate to the tumor to suppress CD8 + T cells. Therapeutically combining ST2 blockade, targeted kinase inhibitors, and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy increases CD8 + T cell activity promoting tumor regression. Importantly, we observe similar activity in human macrophages, and IL-33 expression in sentinel lymph nodes correlates with disease stage and survival in melanoma.

While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how B cell depleting therapies modulate the immune landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. This was accompanied by increases in TNFα messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFα treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells.

To probe this hypothesis, we have studied the effects of site-specific immobilization on the thermal stability of mutants of the thermolysin-like protease from Bacillus stearothermophilus (TLP-ste). This enzyme was chosen because previous studies had revealed which parts of the molecule are likely to be involved in the early steps of thermal unfolding. Cysteine residues were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into various positions of a cysteine-free variant of TLP-ste. The mutant enzymes were immobilized in a site-specific manner onto Activated Thiol-Sepharose. Two mutants (T56C, S65C) having their cysteine in the proposed unfolding region of TLP-ste showed a 9- and 12-fold increase in half-lives at 75 degrees C due to immobilization. The stabilization by immobilization was even larger (33-fold) for the T56C/S65C double mutant enzyme. In contrast, mutants containing cysteines in other parts of the TLP-ste molecule (N181C, S218C, T299C) showed only small increases in half-lives due to immobilization (maximum 2.5-fold). Thus, the stabilization obtained by immobilization was strongly dependent on the site of attachment. It was largest when TLP-ste was fixed to the carrier through its postulated unfolding region. The concept of the unfolding region may be of general use for the design of strategies to stabilize proteins.",29/06/1999,Biochemistry

Chondrocytes-specific depletion of Zbtb20 in adult mice attenuated DMM-induced OA progress, restored the balance of extracellular matrix anabolism and catabolism. The NF-κB signaling mediated disturbance of ECM maintenance by ZBTB20 requires its suppression of Pten and consequent PI3K-Akt signaling activation. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of ZBTB20 was modulated by the kinase LATS1.

Artesunate (ARS) has previously been shown to alleviate UC by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). To further investigate the regulatory effects of ARS on immune dysregulation associated with colitis and the role of ERS in this process, an experimental colitis model was established using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Flow cytometry was employed to assess changes in the Th17/Treg cell ratio in the spleen and macrophage polarization in the intestine, while RT-qPCR was used to quantify the transcription levels of relevant genes in colonic tissues. ARS treatment significantly mitigated DSS-induced pathological damage, reduced the proportion of CD4 + Th17 cells, and downregulated the mRNA expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, and RORγt, while concurrently increasing the proportion of CD4 + Treg cells and upregulating TGF-β expression. Additionally, ARS restored the DSS-induced decline in the M2/M1 macrophage ratio and enhanced the transcription of Arg-1 and IL-10, while suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, including iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Notably, co-treatment with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, ERS inhibitor) augmented the immunoregulatory effects of ARS, whereas 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG, ERS agonist) co-treatment counteracted its protective activity against UC. These findings suggest that ERS plays a crucial role in mediating the therapeutic effects of ARS on UC, particularly by modulating Th17/Treg balance and macrophage polarization.

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1556209,The role of tumor-associated macrophages in lung cancer,"Ronghao Zhu,Jing Huang,Fenhong Qian","Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, necessitating innovative treatments. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are primary immunosuppressive effectors that foster tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. They are broadly categorized into proinflammatory M1 and tumor-promoting M2 phenotypes, with elevated M2 infiltration correlating with poor prognosis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting TAM recruitment, depleting TAMs, or reprogramming M2 to M1 are therefore highly promising. Key signaling pathways, such as CSF-1/CSF-1R, IL-4/IL-13-STAT6, TLRs, and CD47-SIRPα, regulate TAM polarization. Additionally, macrophage-based drug delivery systems permit targeted agent transport to hypoxic regions, enhancing therapy. Preclinical studies combining TAM-targeted therapies with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded improved responses and prolonged survival. Several clinical trials have also reported benefits in previously unresponsive patients. Future work should clarify the roles of macrophage-derived exosomes, cytokines, and additional mediators in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These insights will inform the design of next-generation drug carriers and optimize combination immunotherapies within precision medicine frameworks. Elucidating TAM phenotypes and their regulatory molecules remains central to developing novel strategies that curb tumor progression and ultimately improve outcomes in lung cancer.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of the Cas9d-sgRNA complex in both target-free and target-bound states. Biochemical assays elucidated the PAM recognition and DNA cleavage mechanisms of Cas9d. Structural comparisons revealed that at least 17 base pairs in the guide-target heteroduplex is required for nuclease activity. Beyond its typical role as an adaptor between Cas9 enzymes and targets, the sgRNA also provides structural support and functional regulation for Cas9d. A segment of the sgRNA scaffold interacts with the REC domain to form a functional target recognition module. Upon target binding, this module undergoes a coordinated conformational rearrangement, enabling heteroduplex propagation and facilitating nuclease activity. This hybrid functional module precisely monitors heteroduplex complementarity, resulting in a lower mismatch tolerance compared to SpyCas9. Moreover, structure-guided engineering in both the sgRNA and Cas9d protein led to a more compact Cas9 system with well-maintained nuclease activity. Altogether, our findings provide insights into the target recognition and cleavage mechanisms of Cas9d and shed light on the development of high-fidelity mini-CRISPR tools.",12/03/2025,Nature communications

Many clinical decisions regarding AF are currently based on the binary recognition of AF being present or absent with the categorical appraisal of AF as continued or intermittent. Assessment of AF in clinical trials is largely limited to the time to (first) detection of an AF episode. Substantial evidence shows, however, that the quantitative characteristic of intermittent AF has a relevant impact on symptoms, onset, and progression of AF and AF-related outcomes, including mortality. Atrial fibrillation burden is increasingly recognized as a suitable quantitative measure of intermittent AF that provides an estimate of risk attributable to AF, the efficacy of antiarrhythmic treatment, and the need for oral anticoagulation. However, the diversity of assessment methods and the lack of a consistent definition of AF burden prevent a wider clinical applicability and validation of actionable thresholds of AF burden. To facilitate progress in this field, the AF burden Consensus Group, an international and multidisciplinary collaboration, proposes a unified definition of AF burden. Based on current evidence and using a modified Delphi technique, consensus statements were attained on the four main areas describing AF burden: Defining the characteristics of AF burden, the recording principles, the clinical relevance in major clinical conditions, and implementation as an outcome in the clinic and in clinical trials. According to this consensus, AF burden is defined as the proportion of time spent in AF expressed as a percentage of the recording time, undertaken during a specified monitoring duration. A pivotal requirement for validity and comparability of AF burden assessment is a continuous or near-continuous duration of monitoring that needs to be reported together with the AF burden assessment. This proposed unified definition of AF burden applies independent of comorbidities and outcomes. However, the disease-specific actionable thresholds of AF burden need to be defined according to the targeted clinical outcomes in specific populations. The duration of the longest episode of uninterrupted AF expressed as a time duration should also be reported when appropriate. A unified definition of AF burden will allow for comparability of clinical study data to expand evidence and to establish actionable thresholds of AF burden in various clinical conditions. This proposed definition of AF burden will support risk evaluation and clinical treatment decisions in AF-related disease.

A Diels-Alder reaction initiated both syntheses and established four consecutive stereogenic centers. Important to the synthesis of 2 was a first-generation ozonolysis/olefination/aldol strategy to convert a [2.2.1] bicyclic acid to the [3.3.0]bicyclooctane diquinane 4b. Further elaboration to an appropriate keto azide allowed for a key intramolecular Schmidt reaction to deliver the tricyclic core of the target molecule. In a second-generation approach, a tandem ring-opening/ring-closing metathesis reaction effected an overall [2.2.1] --> [3.3.0] skeletal rearrangement to deliver diquinane 4a. In similar fashion, 4a was manipulated to an appropriate keto azide, and an intramolecular Schmidt reaction generated the core cyclic architecture of 251F.",05/05/2004,Journal of the American Chemical Society

Here, in the Genomics of Chronic Allograft Rejection cohort, pretransplant blood RNA sequencing revealed a cluster of four consecutive missense single-nucelotide polymorphisms (SNPs), within the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B3 (LILRB3) gene, strongly associated with death-censored graft loss. This SNP cluster (named LILRB3-4SNPs) encodes missense mutations at amino acids 617-618 proximal to a SHP1/2 phosphatase-binding immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. The LILRB3-4SNPs cluster is specifically enriched within AA individuals and exhibited a strong association with death-censored graft loss and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline in the AA participants from multiple transplant cohorts. In two large Biobanks (BioMe and All-of-Us), the LILRB3-4SNPs cluster was associated with the early onset of end-stage renal disease and acted synergistically with the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) G1/G2 allele to accelerate disease progression. The SNPs were also linked to multiple immune-related diseases in AA individuals.

Tryptophan catabolism could enhance an array of protumour-genic signals and promoted tumour progression in GBM. However, the mechanisms of oncogenic signalling under tryptophan catabolism and potential therapy targeting this pathway have not been completely understood. Interleukin 4-induced 1 (IL4I1) is newly defined as a tryptophan metabolic enzyme and the potential function in GBM cells still remains unclear. In our study, we found IL4I1 was upregulated in GBM patients and predicted poor prognosis. Upregulation of IL4I1 inhibited GBM ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Further, we found that indole-3-pyruvic acid (I3P) from tryptophan mediated by IL4I1 could scavenge free radical and had an impressive role in inhibiting ferroptosis. To clarify the potential mechanism of I3P in GBM ferroptosis, we performed transcriptomic analyses of GBM cells treated with I3P and found that Nrf2 related genes was upregulated. Further, we found that the ubiquitination of Nrf2 could be attenuate by I3P binding with Nrf2 directly. Knockdown of Nrf2 attenuated the induction of anti-ferroptosis by IL4I1, pointing to Nrf2 as a key mediator of this process. In vivo, overexpression of IL4I1 with ML385 in GBM xenografts promoted ferroptosis. Collectively, this study emphasises the crucial roles of IL4I1 in anti-ferroptosis through Nrf2 signalling pathway but not AHR pathway by catabolism tryptophan, suggesting IL4I1 and tryptophan reprogramming as potential therapeutic targets for GBM.",12/03/2025,Cell proliferation

Although the mechanisms underlying this hypertension are unknown, plasma renin activity is often undetectable, suggesting renin-angiotensin (Ang) pathways are not involved. However, because aldosterone levels are preserved, we tested the hypothesis that Ang II is intact and contributes to the hypertension of autonomic failure. Indeed, circulating Ang II was paradoxically increased in hypertensive autonomic failure patients (52±5 pg/mL, n=11) compared with matched healthy controls (27±4 pg/mL, n=10; P=0.002), despite similarly low renin activity (0.19±0.06 versus 0.34±0.13 ng/mL per hour, respectively; P=0.449). To determine the contribution of Ang II to supine hypertension in these patients, we administered the AT(1) receptor blocker losartan (50 mg) at bedtime in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=11). Losartan maximally reduced systolic blood pressure by 32±11 mm Hg at 6 hours after administration (P<0.05), decreased nocturnal urinary sodium excretion (P=0.0461), and did not worsen morning orthostatic tolerance. In contrast, there was no effect of captopril on supine blood pressure in a subset of these patients. These findings suggest that Ang II formation in autonomic failure is independent of plasma renin activity, and perhaps Ang-converting enzyme. Furthermore, these studies suggest that elevations in Ang II contribute to the hypertension of autonomic failure, and provide rationale for the use of AT(1) receptor blockers for treatment of these patients.",03/2013,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)"

In this study, we present a deep ALS neural net classifier (DANCer) for ALS molecular subtypes. Applying DANCer to an expanded cohort from the NYGC ALS Consortium highlights two subtypes that strongly correlate with disease duration: ALS-TE in cortex and ALS-Glia in spinal cord. Finally, single-nucleus transcriptomes demonstrate that ALS subtypes are recapitulated in neurons and glia, with both ALS-wide and subtype-specific alterations in all cell types.

Of particular interest is the connection between lipid metabolism and the retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (RORC1/RORγ), whose transcriptional activity modulates cancer-related emergency myelopoiesis and is boosted by cholesterol metabolites, while hypercholesterolemia itself is associated with dysregulated myelopoiesis. Here, we show that cancer and hypercholesterolemic diet independently or cooperatively activate RORγ-dependent expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), supporting cancer spread. Moreover, we report that tumor-induced expression of IL-1b and IL-6 promotes hepatic expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in preclinical models and patients. Importantly, lowering cholesterol levels, by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9, prevents MDSC expansion, M2 TAM accumulation and tumor progression in a RORγ-dependent manner, unleashing specific anti-tumor immunity.

The inhibitory immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on immune cells is an important target for tumor immunotherapy. However, the immunomodulatory effects of PD-1 in ASD remains to be elusive. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) exhibit immunomodulatory capabilities in a range of neurological diseases. Our findings indicated the expression of PD-L1 on MSC-EVs, potentially facilitating signaling to PD-1-expressing microglia. Here, we showed how MSC-EVs activated of PD-L1/PD-1 axis and ameliorated glycolysis, neuroinflammation and autism-like behaviors. After first detecting elevated glycolysis and neuroinflammation in prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from the maternal immune activation (MIA) mice, we also demonstrated that PD-1 expression level was upregulated in microglia. Following given MSC-EVs carried PD-L1 into adult MIA offspring mice via intranasal administration, which bound with PD-1 on microglia and then the autism-like behaviors were alleviated as well. Further experiments verified that MSC-EVs could decreased the level of glycolysis and neuroinflammation by PD-1/ERK/HIF-1α pathway in the primary microglia in PFC of MIA offspring mice. Pharmacological blockade and genetic inhibition of PD-1 could weaken the effect of MSC-EVs and aggravate microglial dysfunction, glycolysis and autism-like behaviors in MIA offspring mice. Futhermore, PD-L1 deficient weakened the effect of MSC-EVs on neuroinflammation, glycolysis and autism-like behaviors in MIA offspring mice. Our research indicated the significant immunomodulatory capabilities of MSC-EVs, which play an important role in reprogramming microglial glucose metabolism and suppressing neuroinflammation in ASD. By activating the PD-L1/PD-1 axis and inhibiting the downstream ERK/HIF-1α pathway, MSC-EVs were found to alleviate autism-like behaviors, which revealing a novel pathological mechanism and offering promising therapeutic insights into ASD.",11/03/2025,Journal of nanobiotechnology

Traditional approaches combining conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors with neoantigen vaccines have shown some promise in treating PDAC but are often compromised by intratumoral T lymphocyte exhaustion and systemic toxicity. Hence, novel approaches are needed to address these challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that mRNA polymeric nanoparticles encoding anti-PD-1 antibodies in situ at the tumor site enhance the therapeutic efficacy of neoantigen-based mRNA vaccine for PDAC. This mRNA-based, in situ anti-PD-1 antibody production strategy also protects tumor-infiltrating T cells from PD-1 inhibition, potentially reducing the toxicities induced by systemic checkpoint inhibition.

However, the molecular mechanism by which NBS1 mutations cause clinical phenotypes of NBS, such as craniofacial dysmorphism, is still unclear. Here, we show that NBS1 localizes at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci in nucleoli and interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription machinery including RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and TCOF1. Loss of NBS1 impairs Pol I-dependent transcription of pre-rRNA and induces nucleolar stress. In particular, lacking Nbs1 in mouse neural crest cells not only leads to the reduction of ribosome biogenesis but also craniofacial abnormalities during prenatal development. Moreover, the C-terminus of NBS1 is associated with pre-rRNA and a number of pre-rRNA processing factors, which may also facilitate pre-rRNA maturation. Taken together, our study reveals the functions of NBS1 in rRNA biogenesis.",18/03/2025,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

This heterogeneity currently precludes a gold standard for objectively defining resolution of inflammation following treatment, with enthesitis posing a particular challenge. Despite these difficulties, we apply lessons learned from rheumatoid arthritis to describe how patients with PsA and an inadequate response to therapy can be designated within two patient subgroups, characterized by persistent inflammatory PsA (PIPsA) and non-inflammatory PsA (NIPsA), respectively. The NIPsA phenotype is defined by the lack of ongoing joint inflammation, as confirmed through clinical assessment and imaging, along with normalized inflammatory marker levels. NIPsA might be associated with obesity, biomechanical-related pain, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, secondary post-inflammatory damage and central pain mechanisms. In this article, we frame PsA composite outcomes measures in relationship to the PIPsA and NIPsA phenotypes and propose that this approach might help to minimize unnecessary or ineffective cycling of PsA therapy in patients who acquire dominant non-inflammatory mechanisms and might also inform future trial design.",12/03/2025,Nature reviews.

GPMC have an increased risk of progression to gastric adenocarcinoma. Gastric cancer (GC) in the United States represents an important cancer disparity because incidence rates are 2- to 13-fold greater in non-White individuals, particularly early-generation immigrants from regions of high GC incidence. The US 5-year survival rate for GC is 36%, which falls short of global standards and is driven by the fact that only a small percentage of GC in the US is diagnosed in the early, curable stage. This document represents the first iteration of American College of Gastroenterology guidelines on this topic and encompasses endoscopic surveillance for high-risk patients with GPMC, the performance of high-quality endoscopy and image-enhanced endoscopy for diagnosis and surveillance, GPMC histology criteria and reporting, endoscopic treatment of dysplasia, the role of Helicobacter pylori eradication, general risk reduction measures, and the management of autoimmune gastritis and gastric epithelial polyps. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on upper endoscopic screening for GC/GPMC detection in US populations deemed high-risk for GC. Surveillance endoscopy is recommended for individuals at high risk for GPMC progression, as defined by endoscopic, histologic, and demographic factors, typically every 3 years, but an individualized interval may be warranted. H. pylori testing, treatment, and eradication confirmation are recommended in all individuals with GPMC. Extensive high-quality data from US populations regarding GPMC management are lacking, but continue to accrue, and the quality of evidence for the recommendations presented herein should be interpreted with this dynamic context in mind. The GPMC research and education agendas are broad and include high-quality prospective studies evaluating opportunistic endoscopic screening for GC/GPMC, refined delineation of what constitutes ""high-risk"" populations, development of novel biomarkers, alignment of best practices, implementation of training programs for improved GPMC/GC detection, and evaluation of the impact of these interventions on GC incidence and mortality in the US.",12/03/2025,The American journal of gastroenterology

10.7554/eLife.102226,Nuclear Argonaute protein NRDE-3 switches small RNA partners during embryogenesis to mediate temporal-specific gene regulatory activity,"Shihui Chen,Carolyn Marie Phillips","RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved pathway that utilizes Argonaute proteins and their associated small RNAs to exert gene regulatory function on complementary transcripts. While the majority of germline-expressed RNAi proteins reside in perinuclear germ granules, it is unknown whether and how RNAi pathways are spatially organized in other cell types. Here, we find that the small RNA biogenesis machinery is spatially and temporally organized during Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis. Specifically, the RNAi factor, SIMR-1, forms visible concentrates during mid-embryogenesis that contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a poly-UG polymerase, and the unloaded nuclear Argonaute protein, NRDE-3. Curiously, coincident with the appearance of the SIMR granules, the small RNAs bound to NRDE-3 switch from predominantly CSR-class 22G-RNAs to ERGO-dependent 22G-RNAs. NRDE-3 binds ERGO-dependent 22G-RNAs in the somatic cells of larvae and adults to silence ERGO-target genes; here we further demonstrate that NRDE-3-bound, CSR-class 22G-RNAs repress transcription in oocytes. Thus, our study defines two separable roles for NRDE-3, targeting germline-expressed genes during oogenesis to promote global transcriptional repression, and switching during embryogenesis to repress recently duplicated genes and retrotransposons in somatic cells, highlighting the plasticity of Argonaute proteins and the need for more precise temporal characterization of Argonaute-small RNA interactions.",13/03/2025,eLife

A burgeoning marketplace offers an expanding array of testing options. In many cases, direct-to-consumer genetic testing advertises information that could inform one's risk of heritable disease, including insight into having a genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease or data about gene-drug interactions that could affect response to cardiovascular medications. Navigating clinical questions about direct-to-consumer genetic testing involves understanding the evolution and oversight of the marketplace; the scope of direct-to-consumer genetic testing offerings; and the risks, benefits, and limitations of said testing. In this American Heart Association scientific statement, we summarize the state of the direct-to-consumer genetic testing industry, review types of cardiovascular genetic information that may be included in direct-to-consumer genetic testing, describe approaches to evaluate test quality, and provide resources for clinicians navigating questions about direct-to-consumer genetic testing. If direct-to-consumer genetic test information is used in clinical care, care should be taken to assess the limitations of the test, to contextualize the information specifically to the patient, and to corroborate potentially actionable monogenic findings.",13/03/2025,Circulation

In this context, T-cell engagers (TCEs), which induce T-cell-mediated killing of cancer cells by binding the CD3 receptor on T cells and a specific tumor antigen expressed on malignant cells, represent a promising therapeutic option. Multiple studies have explored the use of TCEs in previously treated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and several ongoing trials are currently assessing novel TCEs either as single agents or in combinatorial regimens with molecules with a distinct mechanism of action (eg, androgen receptor pathway inhibitors and other immune-targeting agents). Although TCEs have shown promising antitumor activity with prostate-specific antigen and radiographic responses, they still face considerable challenges that prevent their implementation into clinical practice. These include their immunogenicity and the development of antidrug antibodies, which could impact their serum drug exposure, as well as their toxicity profile involving cytokine release syndrome and other immune-related adverse events. To improve their efficacy and pending the results of ongoing trials, there could be a role for combinatorial regimens, administration in earlier lines of therapy, and biomarker-driven selection.",11/03/2025,European urology

Contrary to the rapid lethality caused by SOS1 genetic ablation in SOS2 KO mice, SOS1 pharmacological inhibition by its specific inhibitor BI-3406 did not significantly affect animal weight/viability nor cause noteworthy systemic toxicity. Allograft assays using different KRAS mut cell lines showed that treatment with BI-3406 impaired RAS activation and RAS downstream signaling and decreased tumor burden and disease progression as a result of both tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic therapeutic effects of the drug. Consistent with prior genetic evidence and the KRAS mut allografts assays in immunocompromised mice, our analyses using an in vivo model of KRAS G12D -driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in immunocompetent mice showed that single, systemic BI-3406 treatment impaired tumor growth and downmodulated protumorigenic components of the tumor microenvironment comparably to SOS1 genetic ablation or to treatment with the specific KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133. Furthermore, markedly stronger, synergistic antitumor effects were observed upon concomitant treatment with BI-3406 and MRTX1133 in the same in vivo LUAD mouse model. Our data confirm SOS1 as an actionable therapy target in RAS-dependent cancers and suggest that BI-3406 treatment may yield clinical benefit both as monotherapy or as a potential combination partner for multiple RAS-targeting strategies.",18/03/2025,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

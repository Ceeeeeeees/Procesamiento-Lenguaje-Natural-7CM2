10.48550./arXiv.2503.11571,"RASA: Replace Anyone, Say Anything -- A Training-Free Framework for Audio-Driven and Universal Portrait Video Editing","Tianrui Pan, Lin Liu, Jie Liu, Xiaopeng Zhang, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu, Qi Tian","Portrait video editing focuses on modifying specific attributes of portrait videos, guided by audio or video streams. Previous methods typically either concentrate on lip-region reenactment or require training specialized models to extract keypoints for motion transfer to a new identity. In this paper, we introduce a training-free universal portrait video editing framework that provides a versatile and adaptable editing strategy. This framework supports portrait appearance editing conditioned on the changed first reference frame, as well as lip editing conditioned on varied speech, or a combination of both. It is based on a Unified Animation Control (UAC) mechanism with source inversion latents to edit the entire portrait, including visual-driven shape control, audio-driven speaking control, and inter-frame temporal control. Furthermore, our method can be adapted to different scenarios by adjusting the initial reference frame, enabling detailed editing of portrait videos with specific head rotations and facial expressions. This comprehensive approach ensures a holistic and flexible solution for portrait video editing. The experimental results show that our model can achieve more accurate and synchronized lip movements for the lip editing task, as well as more flexible motion transfer for the appearance editing task.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.11647,ReCamMaster: Camera-Controlled Generative Rendering from A Single Video,"Jianhong Bai, Menghan Xia, Xiao Fu, Xintao Wang, Lianrui Mu, Jinwen Cao, Zuozhu Liu, Haoji Hu, Xiang Bai, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang","Camera control has been actively studied in text or image conditioned video generation tasks. However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism -- its capability often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments tell that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting. Project page: this https URL",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.11633,Seeing and Seeing Through the Glass: Real and Synthetic Data for Multi-Layer Depth Estimation,"Hongyu Wen, Yiming Zuo, Venkat Subramanian, Patrick Chen, Jia Deng","Transparent objects are common in daily life, and understanding their multi-layer depth information -- perceiving both the transparent surface and the objects behind it -- is crucial for real-world applications that interact with transparent materials. In this paper, we introduce LayeredDepth, the first dataset with multi-layer depth annotations, including a real-world benchmark and a synthetic data generator, to support the task of multi-layer depth estimation. Our real-world benchmark consists of 1,500 images from diverse scenes, and evaluating state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on it reveals that they struggle with transparent objects. The synthetic data generator is fully procedural and capable of providing training data for this task with an unlimited variety of objects and scene compositions. Using this generator, we create a synthetic dataset with 15,300 images. Baseline models training solely on this synthetic dataset produce good cross-domain multi-layer depth estimation. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art single-layer depth models on it substantially improves their performance on transparent objects, with quadruplet accuracy on our benchmark increased from 55.14% to 75.20%.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.11579,Vamba: Understanding Hour-Long Videos with Hybrid Mamba-Transformers,"Weiming Ren, Wentao Ma, Huan Yang, Cong Wei, Ge Zhang, Wenhu Chen","State-of-the-art transformer-based large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to handle hour-long video inputs due to the quadratic complexity of the causal self-attention operations, leading to high computational costs during training and inference. Existing token compression-based methods reduce the number of video tokens but often incur information loss and remain inefficient for extremely long sequences. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to build a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to encode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA can encode more than 1024 frames (640$\times$360) on a single GPU, while transformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA achieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and inference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to transformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA improves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding benchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong performance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

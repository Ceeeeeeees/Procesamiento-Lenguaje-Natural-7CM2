10.48550./arXiv.2503.10620,From TOWER to SPIRE: Adding the Speech Modality to a Text-Only LLM,"Kshitij Ambilduke, Ben Peters, Sonal Sannigrahi, Anil Keshwani, Tsz Kin Lam, Bruno Martins, Marcely Zanon Boito, André F.T. Martins","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance and generalization capabilities across multiple languages and tasks, making them very attractive targets for multi-modality integration (e.g., images or speech). In this work, we extend an existing LLM to the speech modality via speech discretization and continued pre-training. In particular, we are interested in multilingual LLMs, such as TOWER, as their pre-training setting allows us to treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. The resulting open-source model, SPIRE, is able to transcribe and translate English speech input while maintaining TOWER's original performance on translation-related tasks, showcasing that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LLM adaptation. We make our code and models available to the community.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10617,Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning for Adaptive Large Language Models,Andy Zhou,"Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10533,The Impact of Item-Writing Flaws on Difficulty and Discrimination in Item Response Theory,"Robin Schmucker, Steven Moore","High-quality test items are essential for educational assessments, particularly within Item Response Theory (IRT). Traditional validation methods rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features. However, their relationship to IRT parameters remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study involving over 7,000 multiple-choice questions across various STEM subjects (e.g., math and biology). Using an automated approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty and discrimination parameters, particularly in life and physical science domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors). Overall, while IWFs are useful for predicting IRT parameters--particularly for screening low-difficulty MCQs--they cannot replace traditional data-driven validation methods. Our findings highlight the need for further research on domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand domain-specific content for robust item validation.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Hedderich","Discourse understanding is essential for many NLP tasks, yet most existing work remains constrained by framework-dependent discourse representations. This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers. Lastly, our error analysis provides an account of challenging relation classes.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

To address this gap, we introduce MMLU-ProX, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark covering 13 typologically diverse languages with approximately 11,829 questions per language. Building on the challenging reasoning-focused design of MMLU-Pro, our framework employs a semi-automatic translation process: translations generated by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rigorously evaluated by expert annotators to ensure conceptual accuracy, terminological consistency, and cultural relevance. We comprehensively evaluate 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using 5-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and zero-shot prompting strategies, analyzing their performance across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Our experiments reveal consistent performance degradation from high-resource languages to lower-resource ones, with the best models achieving over 70% accuracy on English but dropping to around 40% for languages like Swahili, highlighting persistent gaps in multilingual capabilities despite recent advances. MMLU-ProX is an ongoing project; we are expanding our benchmark by incorporating additional languages and evaluating more language models to provide a more comprehensive assessment of multilingual capabilities.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

In this paper, we study a simple method for handling document-level machine translation, by leveraging previous contexts in a multi-turn conversational manner. Specifically, by decomposing documents into segments and iteratively translating them while maintaining previous turns, this method ensures coherent translations without additional training, and can fully re-use the KV cache of previous turns thus minimizing computational overhead. We further propose a `source-primed' method that first provides the whole source document before multi-turn translation. We empirically show this multi-turn method outperforms both translating entire documents in a single turn and translating each segment independently according to multiple automatic metrics in representative LLMs, establishing a strong baseline for document-level translation using LLMs.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

In this study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3 Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however, struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only 40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical practice. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based diagnostic systems and provide a roadmap for future enhancements in AI-driven healthcare.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Existing approaches either solely optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference, overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D$^2$PO), a new learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism for extensive exploration via trial-and-error. Extensive experiments on VoTa-Bench demonstrate that our D$^2$PO-based method significantly outperforms existing methods and GPT-4o when applied to Qwen2-VL (7B), LLaVA-1.6 (7B), and LLaMA-3.2 (11B), achieving superior task success rates with more efficient execution paths.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10470,"Statistical Analysis of Sentence Structures through ASCII, Lexical Alignment and PCA",Abhijeet Sahdev,"While utilizing syntactic tools such as parts-of-speech (POS) tagging has helped us understand sentence structures and their distribution across diverse corpora, it is quite complex and poses a challenge in natural language processing (NLP). This study focuses on understanding sentence structure balance - usages of nouns, verbs, determiners, etc - harmoniously without relying on such tools. It proposes a novel statistical method that uses American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) codes to represent text of 11 text corpora from various sources and their lexical category alignment after using their compressed versions through PCA, and analyzes the results through histograms and normality tests such as Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling Tests. By focusing on ASCII codes, this approach simplifies text processing, although not replacing any syntactic tools but complementing them by offering it as a resource-efficient tool for assessing text balance. The story generated by Grok shows near normality indicating balanced sentence structures in LLM outputs, whereas 4 out of the remaining 10 pass the normality tests. Further research could explore potential applications in text quality evaluation and style analysis with syntactic integration for more broader tasks.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

We first focus on training long COT models from scratch, specifically starting from models initially lacking long COT capabilities. Using a curriculum training recipe consisting of two-stage SFT and semi-on-policy DPO, we train our model Light-R1-32B from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, resulting in superior math performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. Despite being trained exclusively on math data, Light-R1-32B shows strong generalization across other domains. In the subsequent phase of this work, we highlight the significant benefit of the 3k dataset constructed for the second SFT stage on enhancing other models. By fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models using this dataset, we obtain new SOTA models in 7B and 14B, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.
Furthermore, we extend our work by applying reinforcement learning, specifically GRPO, on long-COT models to further improve reasoning performance. We successfully train our final Light-R1-14B-DS with RL, achieving SOTA performance among 14B parameter models in math. With AIME24 & 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, Light-R1-14B-DS surpasses even many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Its RL training also exhibits well expected behavior, showing simultaneous increase in response length and reward score.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10452,DynaCode: A Dynamic Complexity-Aware Code Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation,"Wenhao Hu, Jinhao Duan, Chunchen Wei, Li Zhang, Yue Zhang, Kaidi Xu","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in code generation tasks. However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Our evaluation suite, the first of its kind, contains two complementary components: (1) VisTai-MCQ, a collection of manually curated exam multi-choice questions from 21 academic subjects designed to test the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of VLMs; and (2) VisTai-Dialogue, an open dialogue benchmark comprising 131 image-question pairs manually created to evaluate VLMs' ability in free-form dialogue generation within Taiwanese cultural contexts. These benchmarks address a critical gap in the evaluation landscape, where existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or Simplified Chinese, neglecting the unique linguistic and cultural aspects of Traditional Chinese used in regions like Taiwan and Hong Kong.

These private SLMs typically have limited effectiveness. To boost the performance of private SLMs, this paper proposes to ask general LLMs for help. The general LLMs can be APIs or larger LLMs whose inference cost the developers can afford.

A Taxonomy Image Generation Benchmark,"Viktor Moskvoretskii, Alina Lobanova, Ekaterina Neminova, Chris Biemann, Alexander Panchenko, Irina Nikishina","This paper explores the feasibility of using text-to-image models in a zero-shot setup to generate images for taxonomy concepts. While text-based methods for taxonomy enrichment are well-established, the potential of the visual dimension remains unexplored. To address this, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for Taxonomy Image Generation that assesses models' abilities to understand taxonomy concepts and generate relevant, high-quality images. The benchmark includes common-sense and randomly sampled WordNet concepts, alongside the LLM generated predictions. The 12 models are evaluated using 9 novel taxonomy-related text-to-image metrics and human feedback. Moreover, we pioneer the use of pairwise evaluation with GPT-4 feedback for image generation. Experimental results show that the ranking of models differs significantly from standard T2I tasks. Playground-v2 and FLUX consistently outperform across metrics and subsets and the retrieval-based approach performs poorly.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10354,A Hybrid Architecture with Efficient Fine Tuning for Abstractive Patent Document Summarization,"Nevidu Jayatilleke, Ruvan Weerasinghe","Automatic patent summarization approaches that help in the patent analysis and comprehension procedure are in high demand due to the colossal growth of innovations. The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier than archetypal documents, which intricates the process of extracting pertinent information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10351,New Trends for Modern Machine Translation with Large Reasoning Models,"Sinuo Liu, Chenyang Lyu, Minghao Wu, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang","Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), particularly those leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT), have opened brand new possibility for Machine Translation (MT). This position paper argues that LRMs substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT paradigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent, audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and inference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios in a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

During generation, temporary representations -stored in the so-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale linearly with context length. We introduce KV-Distill, a Transformer compression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly shorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model capabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher pairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question answering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific contexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream performance. We demonstrate the generalizability of KV-Distill across various model sizes and architectures.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10298,Proceedings of the ISCA/ITG Workshop on Diversity in Large Speech and Language Models,"Sebastian Möller, Pia Knoeferle, Britta Schulte, Nils Feldhus","Machine learning techniques have conquered many different tasks in speech and natural language processing, such as speech recognition, information extraction, text and speech generation, and human machine interaction using natural language or speech (chatbots). Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage. The workshop sets out to discuss this problem based on scientific contributions from the perspective of computer science and linguistics (including computational linguistics and NLP).",12/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Our results reveal, among others, that discussions leading to deletion are easier to predict, and that, surprisingly, self-produced tags (keep, delete or redirect) don't always help guiding the classifiers, presumably because of users' hesitation or deliberation within comments.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Automatic text summarization has emerged as a powerful tool to condense lengthy documents into concise and informative summaries. Depending on the approach used, text summarization can be categorized as either extractive or abstractive. While extractive methods are commonly used due to their simplicity, they often miss important information. On the other hand, Abstractive Summarization can generate more coherent and informative summaries by understanding the underlying meaning of the text. Abstractive techniques have gained attention in various languages, and recent advancements have been achieved through pre-training models such as BERT, BART, and T5. However, the challenge of summarizing long documents remains, and alternative models like Longformer have been introduced to address this limitation. In this context, this paper focuses on abstractive summarization in the Persian language. The authors introduce a new dataset of 300,000 full-text Persian papers obtained from the Ensani website and apply the ARMAN model, based on the Longformer architecture, to generate summaries.

Existing methods primarily focus on aligning inputs and outputs across modalities while overlooking deeper semantic alignment within model representations. To address this limitation, we propose an Adaptive Inner Speech-Text Alignment (AI-STA) method to bridge the modality gap by explicitly aligning speech and text representations at selected layers within LLMs. To achieve this, we leverage the optimal transport (OT) theory to quantify fine-grained representation discrepancies between speech and text. Furthermore, we utilize the cross-modal retrieval technique to identify the layers that are best suited for alignment and perform joint training on these layers. Experimental results on speech translation (ST) tasks demonstrate that AI-STA significantly improves the translation performance of large speech-text models (LSMs), outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Additionally, PRISM leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to incorporate long-horizon considerations, thereby preventing the short-sighted feedback often seen in static preference comparisons. In contrast to conventional PBRL techniques, this integration of 3D perception and future-oriented reasoning leads to significant gains in preference agreement rates, faster policy convergence, and robust generalization across unseen robotic environments. Our empirical results, spanning tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation, highlight PRISM's potential for real-world applications where precise spatial understanding and reliable long-term decision-making are critical. By bridging 3D geometric awareness with CoT-driven preference modeling, PRISM establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable, human-aligned reinforcement learning.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

While effective, these methods require labor-intensive prompt engineering, raising the question of whether reasoning can be induced without reliance on explicit prompts. In this work, we unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without explicit prompting. Inspired by zero-shot CoT and CoT-decoding, we propose a novel decoding strategy that systematically nudges LLMs to continue reasoning, thereby preventing immature reasoning processes. Specifically, we monitor the model's generation and inject a designated phrase whenever it is likely to conclude its response prematurely, before completing the reasoning process. Our experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed strategy substantially improves LLM reasoning capabilities, highlighting the potential of decoding-based interventions as an alternative to traditional prompting techniques.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Ngai, Emad Barsoum","Speculative decoding (SPD) aims to accelerate the auto-regressive token generation process of a target Large Language Model (LLM). Some approaches employ a draft model with multiple heads to predict a sequence of future tokens, where each head handles a token in the sequence. The target LLM verifies the predicted sequence and accepts aligned tokens, enabling efficient multi-token generation. However, existing methods assume that all tokens within a sequence are equally important, employing identical head structures and relying on a single-generation paradigm, either serial or parallel. To this end, we theoretically demonstrate that initial tokens in the draft sequence are more important than later ones. Building on this insight, we propose Gumiho, a hybrid model combining serial and parallel heads. Specifically, given the critical importance of early tokens, we employ a sophisticated Transformer architecture for the early draft heads in a serial configuration to improve accuracy. For later tokens, we utilize multiple lightweight MLP heads operating in parallel to enhance efficiency. By allocating more advanced model structures and longer running times to the early heads, Gumiho achieves improved overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, fully validating its effectiveness.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability.

Current approaches typically address this issue through online sampling from the target policy, which requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we hypothesize that during off-policy training, while the ranking order of output generated by policy changes, their overall distribution remains relatively stable. This stability allows the transformation of the sampling process from the target policy into a re-ranking of preference data. Building on this hypothesis, We propose a new framework that leverages the model's intrinsic safety judgment capability to extract reward signals, which are then used to calculate label confidence for preferences reordering.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical solution, supported by several theoretical studies. However, current CoT-based methods (including ToT, GoT, etc.) generally adopt a ""one-prompt-fits-all"" strategy, using fixed templates (e.g., ""think step by step"") across diverse reasoning tasks. This method forces models to navigate an extremely complex prompt space to identify effective reasoning paths. The current prompt designing research are also heavily relying on trial-and-error rather than theoretically informed guidance. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the complexity and interplay between two crucial spaces: the prompt space (the space of potential prompt structures) and the answer space (the space of reasoning solutions generated by LLMs) in CoT reasoning. We demonstrate how reliance on a single universal prompt (e.g. think step by step) can negatively impact the theoretical computability of LLMs, illustrating that prompt complexity directly influences the structure and effectiveness of the navigation in answer space. Our analysis highlights that sometimes human supervision is critical for efficiently navigating the prompt space.

Funnell, James Booker, Sze H M Lam, Ugan Reddy, Kawsar Noor, Richard JB Dobson, Astri M.V. Luoma, Hani J Marcus","Introduction: Timely care in a specialised neuro-intensive therapy unit (ITU) reduces mortality and hospital stays, with planned admissions being safer than unplanned ones. However, post-operative care decisions remain subjective. This study used artificial intelligence (AI), specifically natural language processing (NLP) to analyse electronic health records (EHRs) and predict ITU admissions for elective surgery patients. Methods: This study analysed the EHRs of elective neurosurgery patients from University College London Hospital (UCLH) using NLP. Patients were categorised into planned high dependency unit (HDU) or ITU admission; unplanned HDU or ITU admission; or ward / overnight recovery (ONR). The Medical Concept Annotation Tool (MedCAT) was used to identify SNOMED-CT concepts within the clinical notes. We then explored the utility of these identified concepts for a range of AI algorithms trained to predict ITU admission. Results: The CogStack-MedCAT NLP model, initially trained on hospital-wide EHRs, underwent two refinements: first with data from patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) and then with data from Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) patients, achieving a concept detection F1-score of 0.93. This refined model was then used to extract concepts from EHR notes of 2,268 eligible neurosurgical patients. We integrated the extracted concepts into AI models, including a decision tree model and a neural time-series model. Using the simpler decision tree model, we achieved a recall of 0.87 (CI 0.82 - 0.91) for ITU admissions, reducing the proportion of unplanned ITU cases missed by human experts from 36% to 4%. Conclusion: The NLP model, refined for accuracy, has proven its efficiency in extracting relevant concepts, providing a reliable basis for predictive AI models to use in clinically valid applications.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Mapping Scientific Research with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models,"Abhipsha Das, Nicholas Lourie, Siavash Golkar, Mariel Pettee","The scientific literature's exponential growth makes it increasingly challenging to navigate and synthesize knowledge across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for understanding scientific text, but they fail to capture detailed relationships across large bodies of work. Unstructured approaches, like retrieval augmented generation, can sift through such corpora to recall relevant facts; however, when millions of facts influence the answer, unstructured approaches become cost prohibitive. Structured representations offer a natural complement -- enabling systematic analysis across the whole corpus. Recent work enhances LLMs with unstructured or semistructured representations of scientific concepts; to complement this, we try extracting structured representations using LLMs. By combining LLMs' semantic understanding with a schema of scientific concepts, we prototype a system that answers precise questions about the literature as a whole. Our schema applies across scientific fields and we extract concepts from it using only 20 manually annotated abstracts. To demonstrate the system, we extract concepts from 30,000 papers on arXiv spanning astrophysics, fluid dynamics, and evolutionary biology. The resulting database highlights emerging trends and, by visualizing the knowledge graph, offers new ways to explore the ever-growing landscape of scientific knowledge.

Our results highlight the usefulness of Transformer topologies for implicit personality and gender classification, hence stressing their efficiency and stressing important trade-offs between accuracy and coverage in realistic conversational environments. With regard to gender classification, the model obtained an accuracy of 74.4\%, therefore capturing gender-specific language patterns.

Through controlled experiments, we identify poor recall of implicit facts as the primary cause of failure, which significantly hampers reasoning performance. Interestingly, we observe that the internal attention weights from the generated CoT tokens can effectively ground implicit facts, even when these facts are not explicitly recalled. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free algorithm, Attrieval, which leverages attention weights to retrieve relevant facts from the long context and incorporates them into the reasoning process.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Gromov-Wasserstein Scoring Model Merging (GW-SMM) method, which merges models based on feature distribution similarities measured via the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Our approach begins by extracting features from student responses using individual models, capturing both item-specific context and unique learned representations. The Gromov-Wasserstein distance then quantifies the similarity between these feature distributions, identifying the most compatible models for merging. Models exhibiting the smallest pairwise distances, typically in pairs or trios, are merged by combining only the shared layers preceding the classification head. This strategy results in a unified feature extractor while preserving separate classification heads for item-specific scoring. We validated our approach against human expert knowledge and a GPT-o1-based merging method. GW-SMM consistently outperformed both, achieving a higher micro F1 score, macro F1 score, exact match accuracy, and per-label accuracy. The improvements in micro F1 and per-label accuracy were statistically significant compared to GPT-o1-based merging (p=0.04, p=0.01).

The growth of publicly available online restaurant reviews and advancements in large language models (LLMs) present potential opportunities to extend disease surveillance by identifying public reports of GI illness. In this study, we introduce a novel annotation schema, developed with experts in GI illness, applied to the Yelp Open Dataset of reviews. Our annotations extend beyond binary disease detection, to include detailed extraction of information on symptoms and foods. We evaluate the performance of open-weight LLMs across these three tasks: GI illness detection, symptom extraction, and food extraction.

Our results show that using prompt-based approaches, LLMs achieve micro-F1 scores of over 90% for all three of our tasks. Using prompting alone, we achieve micro-F1 scores that exceed those of smaller fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate the robustness of LLMs in GI illness detection across three bias-focused experiments.

We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich.

Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs.

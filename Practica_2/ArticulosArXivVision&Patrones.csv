10.48550./arXiv.2503.10639,GoT: Unleashing Reasoning Capability of Multimodal Large Language Model for Visual Generation and Editing,"Rongyao Fang, Chengqi Duan, Kun Wang, Linjiang Huang, Hao Li, Shilin Yan, Hao Tian, Xingyu Zeng, Rui Zhao, Jifeng Dai, Xihui Liu, Hongsheng Li","Current image generation and editing methods primarily process textual prompts as direct inputs without reasoning about visual composition and explicit operations. We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at this https URL.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10638,Studying Classifier(-Free) Guidance From a Classifier-Centric Perspective,"Xiaoming Zhao, Alexander G. Schwing","Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10635,A Frustratingly Simple Yet Highly Effective Attack Baseline: Over 90% Success Rate Against the Strong Black-box Models of GPT-4.5/4o/o1,"Zhaoyi Li, Xiaohan Zhao, Dong-Dong Wu, Jiacheng Cui, Zhiqiang Shen","Despite promising performance on open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs), transfer-based targeted attacks often fail against black-box commercial LVLMs. Analyzing failed adversarial perturbations reveals that the learned perturbations typically originate from a uniform distribution and lack clear semantic details, resulting in unintended responses. This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core semantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets and methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective solution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10634,V2Edit: Versatile Video Diffusion Editor for Videos and 3D Scenes,"Yanming Zhang, Jun-Kun Chen, Jipeng Lyu, Yu-Xiong Wang","This paper introduces V$^2$Edit, a novel training-free framework for instruction-guided video and 3D scene editing. Addressing the critical challenge of balancing original content preservation with editing task fulfillment, our approach employs a progressive strategy that decomposes complex editing tasks into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Each subtask is controlled through three key synergistic mechanisms: the initial noise, noise added at each denoising step, and cross-attention maps between text prompts and video content. This ensures robust preservation of original video elements while effectively applying the desired edits. Beyond its native video editing capability, we extend V$^2$Edit to 3D scene editing via a ""render-edit-reconstruct"" process, enabling high-quality, 3D-consistent edits even for tasks involving substantial geometric changes such as object insertion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V$^2$Edit achieves high-quality and successful edits across various challenging video editing tasks and complex 3D scene editing tasks, thereby establishing state-of-the-art performance in both domains.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10630,UniGoal: Towards Universal Zero-shot Goal-oriented Navigation,"Hang Yin, Xiuwei Xu, Lingqing Zhao, Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu","In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Although adversarial training has been well studied in natural images, its application to biomedical and microscopy data remains limited. Existing self-supervised adversarial training methods overlook the hierarchical structure of histopathology images, where patient-slide-patch relationships provide valuable discriminative signals. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Adversarial Training (HSAT), which exploits these properties to craft adversarial examples using multi-level contrastive learning and integrate it into adversarial training for enhanced robustness. We evaluate HSAT on multiclass histopathology dataset OpenSRH and the results show that HSAT outperforms existing methods from both biomedical and natural image domains. HSAT enhances robustness, achieving an average gain of 54.31% in the white-box setting and reducing performance drops to 3-4% in the black-box setting, compared to 25-30% for the baseline. These results set a new benchmark for adversarial training in this domain, paving the way for more robust models.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10627,SciVerse: Unveiling the Knowledge Comprehension and Visual Reasoning of LMMs on Multi-modal Scientific Problems,"Ziyu Guo, Ray Zhang, Hao Chen, Jialin Gao, Dongzhi Jiang, Jiaze Wang, Pheng-Ann Heng","The rapid advancement of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled their application in scientific problem-solving, yet their fine-grained capabilities remain under-explored. In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10626,NIL: No-data Imitation Learning by Leveraging Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models,"Mert Albaba, Chenhao Li, Markos Diomataris, Omid Taheri, Andreas Krause, Michael Black","Acquiring physically plausible motor skills across diverse and unconventional morphologies-including humanoid robots, quadrupeds, and animals-is essential for advancing character simulation and robotics. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations, which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data generation for imitation learning.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10624,ETCH: Generalizing Body Fitting to Clothed Humans via Equivariant Tightness,"Boqian Li, Haiwen Feng, Zeyu Cai, Michael J. Black, Yuliang Xiu","Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings. Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics.

One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model.

We evaluate a range of DiT-based architectures--including PixArt-style and MMDiT variants--and compare them with a standard DiT variant which directly processes concatenated text and noise inputs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that the performance of standard DiT is comparable with those specialized models, while demonstrating superior parameter-efficiency, especially when scaled up. Leveraging the layer-wise parameter sharing strategy, we achieve a further reduction of 66% in model size compared to an MMDiT architecture, with minimal performance impact. Building on an in-depth analysis of critical components such as text encoders and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we introduce DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite.

However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance.

However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning.

Recent advancements in LoRA-based (Low-Rank Adaptation) methods have shown promise in effectively capturing the style of a single image. However, these approaches still face significant challenges such as content inconsistency, style misalignment, and content leakage. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the limitations of the standard diffusion parameterization, which learns to predict noise, in the context of style transfer. To address these issues, we introduce ConsisLoRA, a LoRA-based method that enhances both content and style consistency by optimizing the LoRA weights to predict the original image rather than noise. We also propose a two-step training strategy that decouples the learning of content and style from the reference image. To effectively capture both the global structure and local details of the content image, we introduce a stepwise loss transition strategy.

We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose a three-stage approach ""CoSTA*"" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off. We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training.

We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates.

To address the limitations of existing methods in insufficient exploitation of modal synergistic effects, noise sensitivity, and limited fine-grained alignment capabilities, this paper proposes a dual-stage cross-modal alignment framework. First, we construct vision-text and audio-text contrastive learning networks based on an improved CLIP architecture, achieving preliminary alignment in the feature space through modality-decoupled pre-training. Subsequently, we design a temporal-aware dynamic fusion module that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and gated bidirectional LSTM to respectively capture the macro-evolution patterns of facial expressions and local dynamics of acoustic features. Innovatively, we introduce a quality-guided modality fusion strategy that enables modality compensation under occlusion and noisy scenarios through differentiable weight allocation.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the ""overall truthfulness"" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as ""per-token"" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist ""generic truthful directions"" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks.

We take an approach that progressively expands the generation of dynamic scenes -- first enhancing dynamic content within individual video clip, then extending this capability to create seamless explorations across broad viewpoint ranges. Specifically, we construct a dataset featuring a large degree of dynamics with camera parameter annotations for training while designing a lightweight camera injection module and training scheme to preserve dynamics of the pretrained models. Building on these improved single-clip techniques, we enable extended scene exploration by allowing users to iteratively specify camera trajectories for generating coherent video sequences. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that CameraCtrl Ii enables camera-controlled dynamic scene synthesis with substantially wider spatial exploration than previous approaches.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

In this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain. Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath (55.7%).

A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10568,Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding,"Haopeng Li, Jinyue Yang, Guoqi Li, Huan Wang","We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.94 with only 64 sampling steps, achieving over a 20-fold increase in throughput while reducing memory consumption by over 75% compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

To counteract, various anti-facial recognition techniques have been proposed for privacy protection by adversarially perturbing face images, among which generative makeup-based approaches are the most popular. However, these methods, designed primarily to impersonate specific target identities, can only achieve weak dodging success rates while increasing the risk of targeted abuse. In addition, they often introduce global visual artifacts or a lack of adaptability to accommodate diverse makeup prompts, compromising user satisfaction. To address the above limitations, we develop MASQUE, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates localized adversarial makeups guided by user-defined text prompts. Built upon precise null-text inversion, customized cross-attention fusion with masking, and a pairwise adversarial guidance mechanism using images of the same individual, MASQUE achieves robust dodging performance without requiring any external identity. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source facial recognition models and commercial APIs demonstrate that MASQUE significantly improves dodging success rates over all baselines, along with higher perceptual fidelity and stronger adaptability to various text makeup prompts.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Given any deep vision model that uses a fully connected layer as the output head, VisionLogic transforms neurons in the last layer into predicates and grounds them into vision concepts using causal validation. In this way, VisionLogic can provide local explanations for single images and global explanations for specific classes in the form of logic rules. Compared to existing interpretable visualization tools such as saliency maps, VisionLogic addresses several key challenges, including the lack of causal explanations, overconfidence in visualizations, and ambiguity in interpretation. VisionLogic also facilitates the study of visual concepts encoded by predicates, particularly how they behave under perturbation -- an area that remains underexplored in the field of hidden semantics. Apart from providing better visual explanations and insights into the visual concepts learned by the model, we show that VisionLogic retains most of the neural network's discriminative power in an interpretable and transparent manner. We envision it as a bridge between complex model behavior and human-understandable explanations, providing trustworthy and actionable insights for real-world applications.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce a three-level MLP-Mixer module, which processes spatial features at multiple resolutions while maintaining structural integrity. Experimental results on the ABAW 8th competition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in affective behavior analysis.

However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets. Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps. To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics. We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information. By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation. We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA. Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels. Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively.

Despite significant advancements with models like CLIP that align cross-modal representations, a persistent challenge remains: the hubness problem, where a small subset of samples (hubs) dominate as nearest neighbors, leading to biased representations and degraded retrieval accuracy. Existing methods often mitigate hubness through post-hoc normalization techniques, relying on prior data distributions that may not be practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we directly mitigate hubness during training and introduce NeighborRetr, a novel method that effectively balances the learning of hubs and adaptively adjusts the relations of various kinds of neighbors. Our approach not only mitigates the hubness problem but also enhances retrieval performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple cross-modal retrieval benchmarks.

The audio branches employ pre-trained VGG models to extract VGGish and LogMel features from speech signals. These features undergo temporal modeling using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). We then apply cross-modal attention mechanisms, where visual features interact with audio features through query-key-value attention structures. Finally, the features are concatenated and passed through a regression layer to predict valence and arousal.

This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting.

In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to anomaly detection, termed Hoi2Anomaly, which aims to achieve precise discrimination and localization of anomalies. The proposed methodology involves the construction of a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset comprising human-object interaction (HOI) pairs in anomalous scenarios. Second, we have trained an HOI extractor in threat scenarios to localize and match anomalous actions and entities. Finally, explanatory content is generated for the detected anomalous HOI by fine-tuning the visual language pretraining (VLP) framework.

Existing training-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but require costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain performance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal that the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the accelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight introduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to maintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this finding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token compression framework. The first stage employs an Information-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune low-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide token merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10.

Recent development either relies on correspondence priors for regularization or uses off-the-shelf flow estimators to derive analytical poses. However, the potential for jointly learning scene geometry, camera poses, and dense flow within a unified neural representation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Flow-NeRF, a unified framework that simultaneously optimizes scene geometry, camera poses, and dense optical flow all on-the-fly. To enable the learning of dense flow within the neural radiance field, we design and build a bijective mapping for flow estimation, conditioned on pose. To make the scene reconstruction benefit from the flow estimation, we develop an effective feature enhancement mechanism to pass canonical space features to world space representations, significantly enhancing scene geometry. We validate our model across four important tasks, i.e., novel view synthesis, depth estimation, camera pose prediction, and dense optical flow estimation, using several datasets.

Replacing human observers by computer vision lowers the cost of data collection and therefore allows to collect more extensive datasets. However, the majority of available computer vision algorithms to study animal behaviour is highly tailored towards a single research objective, limiting possibilities for data reuse. In this perspective, pose-estimation in combination with animal tracking offers opportunities to yield a higher level representation capturing both the spatial and temporal component of animal behaviour. Such a higher level representation allows to answer a wide variety of research questions simultaneously, without the need to develop repeatedly tailored computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we therefore first cope with several weaknesses of current pose-estimation algorithms and thereafter introduce KeySORT (Keypoint Simple and Online Realtime Tracking). KeySORT deploys an adaptive Kalman filter to construct tracklets in a bounding-box free manner, significantly improving the temporal consistency of detected keypoints. In this paper, we focus on pose estimation in cattle, but our methodology can easily be generalised to any other animal species. Our test results indicate our algorithm is able to detect up to 80% of the ground truth keypoints with high accuracy, with only a limited drop in performance when daylight recordings are compared to nightvision recordings.

To enhance generalization, we tailor our model to the problem setting by (1) independent image encoding, (2) antisymmetric logit space equivariance, and (3) ordinal scale awareness.

Bagdanov","Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to learn from a sequence of tasks without having access to previous task data. In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, resulting in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to consolidate feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks and employs prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our approach, which we call Elastic Feature Consolidation++ (EFC++) exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on a proposed Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes. In addition, we introduce a post-training prototype re-balancing phase that updates classifiers to compensate for feature drift.

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Efficient and accurate medical waste classification is crucial for mitigating these risks. We explore the integration of capsule networks with a pretrained DenseNet model to improve medical waste classification. To the best of our knowledge, capsule networks have not yet been applied to this task, making this study the first to assess their effectiveness.
A diverse dataset of medical waste images collected from multiple public sources, is used to evaluate three model configurations: (1) a pretrained DenseNet model as a baseline, (2) a pretrained DenseNet with frozen layers combined with a capsule network, and (3) a pretrained DenseNet with unfrozen layers combined with a capsule network. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating capsule networks improves classification performance, with F1 scores increasing from 0.89 (baseline) to 0.92 (hybrid model with unfrozen layers). This highlights the potential of capsule networks to address the spatial limitations of traditional convolutional models and improve classification robustness.
While the capsule-enhanced model demonstrated improved classification performance, direct comparisons with prior studies were challenging due to differences in dataset size and diversity. Previous studies relied on smaller, domain-specific datasets, which inherently yielded higher accuracy. In contrast, our study employs a significantly larger and more diverse dataset, leading to better generalization but introducing additional classification challenges.

The previous nuclei segmentation and classification models require splitting large images into smaller patches for training, leading to two significant issues. First, nuclei at the borders of adjacent patches often misalign during inference. Second, this patch-based approach significantly increases the model's training and inference time. Recently, Mamba has garnered attention for its ability to model large-scale images with linear time complexity and low memory consumption. It offers a promising solution for training nuclei segmentation and classification models on full-sized images. However, the Mamba orientation-based scanning method lacks account for category-specific features, resulting in sub-optimal performance in scenarios with imbalanced class distributions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel scanning strategy based on category probability sorting, which independently ranks and scans features for each category according to confidence from high to low.

Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70.

While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

Efficiently compressing 3D shapes while preserving intricate geometric details remains a key challenge. Existing 3D shape VAEs often employ uniform point sampling and 1D/2D latent representations, such as vector sets or triplanes, leading to significant geometric detail loss due to inadequate surface coverage and the absence of explicit 3D representations in the latent space. Although recent work explores 3D latent representations, their large scale hinders high-resolution encoding and efficient training. Given these challenges, we introduce Hyper3D, which enhances VAE reconstruction through efficient 3D representation that integrates hybrid triplane and octree features. First, we adopt an octree-based feature representation to embed mesh information into the network, mitigating the limitations of uniform point sampling in capturing geometric distributions along the mesh surface. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid latent space representation that integrates a high-resolution triplane with a low-resolution 3D grid. This design not only compensates for the lack of explicit 3D representations but also leverages a triplane to preserve high-resolution details. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper3D outperforms traditional representations by reconstructing 3D shapes with higher fidelity and finer details, making it well-suited for 3D generation pipelines.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

In the latter case, we also use the pre-trained facial expression recognition model to select high-score video frames and prevent their processing with a domain-specific video classifier.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training.

We then contribute to a study to analyze the effect of different data modalities and the benefits of a multimodal fusion-based approach using videos of 20 facial palsy patients and 20 healthy subjects.

Recognizing this need, we introduce a generative framework that seamlessly integrates a partial set of user-provided visual components into a coherent composition while simultaneously sampling the missing parts needed to generate a plausible and complete concept. Our approach builds on a strong and underexplored representation space, extracted from IP-Adapter+, on which we train IP-Prior, a lightweight flow-matching model that synthesizes coherent compositions based on domain-specific priors, enabling diverse and context-aware generations.

In this paper, we investigate concept forgetting and concept confusion in the continual customization. To tackle these challenges, we present ConceptGuard, a comprehensive approach that combines shift embedding, concept-binding prompts and memory preservation regularization, supplemented by a priority queue which can adaptively update the importance and occurrence order of different concepts. These strategies can dynamically update, unbind and learn the relationship of the previous concepts, thus alleviating concept forgetting and confusion.

Hence, protecting facial privacy against unauthorized AFR systems is essential. Inspired by the generation capability of the emerging diffusion models, recent methods employ diffusion models to generate adversarial face images for privacy protection. However, they suffer from the diffusion purification effect, leading to a low protection success rate (PSR). In this paper, we first propose learning unconditional embeddings to increase the learning capacity for adversarial modifications and then use them to guide the modification of the adversarial latent code to weaken the diffusion purification effect. Moreover, we integrate an identity-preserving structure to maintain structural consistency between the original and generated images, allowing human observers to recognize the generated image as having the same identity as the original. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets, i.e., CelebA-HQ and LADN, demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

We propose DreamInsert, which achieves Image-to-Video Object Insertion in a training-free manner for the first time. By incorporating the trajectory of the object into consideration, DreamInsert can predict the unseen object movement, fuse it harmoniously with the background video, and generate the desired video seamlessly. More significantly, DreamInsert is both simple and effective, achieving zero-shot insertion without end-to-end training or additional fine-tuning on well-designed image-video data pairs.

This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories.

For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing.

The MF module employs iterative model averaging to facilitate learning without accessing multi-modal training data on clients. The FW module aims to address the limitations of training data heterogeneity by aligning data distributions across clients. The MIM module aims to model mutual information by maximizing the similarity between images from different modalities. For the experimental analyses, we focus our attention on multi-label classification and pixel-based classification tasks in RS.

Due to factors like motion blur or specific distortions, the quality of different regions in a video varies. Recognizing the region-wise local quality within a video is beneficial for assessing global quality and can guide us in adopting fine-grained enhancement or transcoding strategies. Due to the heavy cost of annotating region-wise quality, the lack of ground truth constraints from relevant datasets further complicates the utilization of local perception. Inspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) that links global quality to the local texture of different regions and their visual saliency, we propose a Kaleidoscope Video Quality Assessment (KVQ) framework, which aims to effectively assess both saliency and local texture, thereby facilitating the assessment of global quality. Our framework extracts visual saliency and allocates attention using Fusion-Window Attention (FWA) while incorporating a Local Perception Constraint (LPC) to mitigate the reliance of regional texture perception on neighboring areas. KVQ obtains significant improvements across multiple scenarios on five VQA benchmarks compared to SOTA methods.

For pruning, we analyze the local structure of primitives using K-nearest neighbors, and retain only relevant ones. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene.

Unlike existing methods that suppress semantic-unrelated information post hoc either in the feature space or the model space, we propose addressing this issue at the input stage, preventing semantic-unrelated patches from propagating through the network. To this end, we introduce Semantically contextualized VIsual Patches (SVIP) for ZSL, a transformer-based framework designed to enhance visual-semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised patch selection mechanism that preemptively learns to identify semantic-unrelated patches in the input space. This is trained with the supervision from aggregated attention scores across all transformer layers, which estimate each patch's semantic score. As removing semantic-unrelated patches from the input sequence may disrupt object structure, we replace them with learnable patch embeddings. With initialization from word embeddings, we can ensure they remain semantically meaningful throughout feature extraction. Extensive experiments on ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that SVIP achieves state-of-the-art performance results while providing more interpretable and semantically rich feature representations.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

In recent years, Prototypical Part Networks has gained traction as an approach for self-explainable neural networks, due to their ability to mimic human visual reasoning by providing explanations based on prototypical object parts. However, the quality of the explanations generated by these methods leaves room for improvement, as the prototypes usually focus on repetitive and redundant concepts. Leveraging recent advances in prototype learning, we present a framework for part-based interpretable image classification that learns a set of semantically distinctive object parts for each class, and provides diverse and comprehensive explanations. The core of our method is to learn the part-prototypes in a non-parametric fashion, through clustering deep features extracted from foundation vision models that encode robust semantic information. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of explanations provided by ProtoPNets, we introduce Distinctiveness Score and Comprehensiveness Score. Through evaluation on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and Stanford Dogs datasets, we show that our framework compares favourably against existing ProtoPNets while achieving better interpretability.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task named amodal reasoning segmentation, aiming to predict the complete amodal shape of occluded objects while providing answers with elaborations based on user text input. We develop a generalizable dataset generation pipeline and introduce a new dataset focusing on daily life scenarios, encompassing diverse real-world occlusions.

The more challenging Few-shot CIL (FSCIL) setting further complicates this by providing only a limited number of samples for each new class, increasing the risk of overfitting in addition to standard CIL challenges. While catastrophic forgetting has been extensively studied, overfitting in FSCIL, especially with large foundation models, has received less attention. To fill this gap, we propose the Singular Value Fine-tuning for FSCIL (SVFCL) and compared it with existing approaches for adapting foundation models to FSCIL, which primarily build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like prompt tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Specifically, SVFCL applies singular value decomposition to the foundation model weights, keeping the singular vectors fixed while fine-tuning the singular values for each task, and then merging them. This simple yet effective approach not only alleviates the forgetting problem but also mitigates overfitting more effectively while significantly reducing trainable parameters.

Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks.

However, the performance of SNN models is often constrained, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel neural network architecture, ST-FlowNet, specifically tailored for optical flow estimation from event-based data. The ST-FlowNet architecture integrates ConvGRU modules to facilitate cross-modal feature augmentation and temporal alignment of the predicted optical flow, improving the network's ability to capture complex motion dynamics. Additionally, to overcome the challenges associated with training SNNs, we introduce a novel approach to derive SNN models from pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) through ANN-to-SNN conversion or our proposed BISNN method. Notably, the BISNN method alleviates the complexities involved in biological parameter selection, further enhancing the robustness of SNNs in optical flow estimation tasks.

Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by reducing biases contrastively or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches improve visual perception at the cost of impairing the language reasoning capability. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. Specifically, by magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses.

However, previous works directly align the feature space with CLIP and fail to learn the semantic knowledge effectively. In this work, we propose a hierarchical semantic distillation framework named HD-OVD to construct a comprehensive distillation process, which exploits generalizable knowledge from the CLIP model in three aspects. In the first hierarchy of HD-OVD, the detector learns fine-grained instance-wise semantics from the CLIP image encoder by modeling relations among single objects in the visual space. Besides, we introduce text space novel-class-aware classification to help the detector assimilate the highly generalizable class-wise semantics from the CLIP text encoder, representing the second hierarchy. Lastly, abundant image-wise semantics containing multi-object and their contexts are also distilled by an image-wise contrastive distillation. Benefiting from the elaborated semantic distillation in triple hierarchies, our HD-OVD inherits generalizable recognition ability from CLIP in instance, class, and image levels. Thus, we boost the novel AP on the OV-COCO dataset to 46.4% with a ResNet50 backbone, which outperforms others by a clear margin.

The core insight in UGP is the elimination of cross-attention mechanisms to improve generalization, allowing the network to concentrate on intra-frame feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a progressive self-attention module to reduce ambiguity in large-scale scenes and integrate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features to incorporate semantic information about scene elements.

We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization.

Additionally, the global tone mapper used in existing methods can impede the learning of both HDR and LDR representations. To address these challenges, we present GaussHDR, which unifies 3D and 2D local tone mapping through 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we design a residual local tone mapper for both 3D and 2D tone mapping that accepts an additional context feature as input.

It has also been used to measure leaf area index and total leaf area. Some studies have used hand-held cameras, image processing 3D reconstruction and unsupervised learning-based methods to estimate the leaf area in plant images. Deep learning works well for object detection and segmentation tasks; however, direct area estimation of objects has not been explored. This work investigates deep learning-based leaf area estimation, for RGBD images taken using a mobile camera setup in real-world scenarios. A dataset for attached leaves captured with a top angle view and a dataset for detached single leaves were collected for model development and testing. First, image processing-based area estimation was tested on manually segmented leaves. Then a Mask R-CNN-based model was investigated, and modified to accept RGBD images and to estimate the leaf area. The detached-leaf data set was then mixed with the attached-leaf plant data set to estimate the single leaf area for plant images, and another network design with two backbones was proposed: one for segmentation and the other for area estimation. Instead of trying all possibilities or random values, an agile approach was used in hyperparameter tuning. The final model was cross-validated with 5-folds and tested with two unseen datasets: detached and attached leaves. The F1 score with 90% IoA for segmentation result on unseen detached-leaf data was 1.0, while R-squared of area estimation was 0.81.

PlanGen integrates layout conditions into the model as context without requiring specialized encoding of local captions and bounding box coordinates, which provides significant advantages over the previous embed-and-pool operations on layout conditions, particularly when dealing with complex layouts. Unified prompting allows PlanGen to perform multitasking training related to layout, including layout planning, layout-to-image generation, image layout understanding, etc. In addition, PlanGen can be seamlessly expanded to layout-guided image manipulation thanks to the well-designed modeling, with teacher-forcing content manipulation policy and negative layout guidance.

To address this limitation, we introduce Proxy-Tuning, leveraging diffusion models to enhance AR models' capabilities in subject-specific image generation. Our method reveals a striking weak-to-strong phenomenon: fine-tuned AR models consistently outperform their diffusion model supervisors in both subject fidelity and prompt adherence. We analyze this performance shift and identify scenarios where AR models excel, particularly in multi-subject compositions and contextual understanding.

Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM.

Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications.

Emotion modeling based on the Valence-Arousal (VA) space enables a more nuanced representation of emotional states. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling long-term dependencies and capturing complex temporal dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel emotion recognition model, Mamba-VA, which leverages the Mamba architecture to efficiently model sequential emotional variations in video frames. First, the model employs a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to extract deep visual features from video frames, enhancing the robustness of temporal information. Then, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is utilized for temporal modeling to capture local temporal dependencies. Subsequently, Mamba is applied for long-sequence modeling, enabling the learning of global emotional trends. Finally, a fully connected (FC) layer performs regression analysis to predict continuous valence and arousal values.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10096,Semantic Latent Motion for Portrait Video Generation,"Qiyuan Zhang, Chenyu Wu, Wenzhang Sun, Huaize Liu, Donglin Di, Wei Chen, Changqing Zou","Recent advancements in portrait video generation have been noteworthy. However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained generation models, which may introduce unrealistic motion and lead to inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Mask Motion Encoder to compress the subject's motion state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the Reasoning step, long-term modeling and efficient reasoning are performed in this latent space to generate motion sequences. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as conditional information to guide the generation model in synthesizing realistic transitions from reference frames to target frames. Thanks to the compact and descriptive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method enables real-time video generation with highly realistic motion. User studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential. Moreover, its fully self-supervised nature suggests promising applications in broader video generation tasks.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

In particular, we assume malicious adversaries exploiting diffusion models for inpainting tasks, such as replacing a specific region with a celebrity. While existing methods for protecting images from manipulation in diffusion-based generative models have primarily focused on image-to-image and text-to-image tasks, the challenge of preventing unauthorized inpainting has been rarely addressed, often resulting in suboptimal protection performance. To mitigate inpainting abuses, we propose ADVPAINT, a novel defensive framework that generates adversarial perturbations that effectively disrupt the adversary's inpainting tasks. ADVPAINT targets the self- and cross-attention blocks in a target diffusion inpainting model to distract semantic understanding and prompt interactions during image generation. ADVPAINT also employs a two-stage perturbation strategy, dividing the perturbation region based on an enlarged bounding box around the object, enhancing robustness across diverse masks of varying shapes and sizes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADVPAINT's perturbations are highly effective in disrupting the adversary's inpainting tasks, outperforming existing methods; ADVPAINT attains over a 100-point increase in FID and substantial decreases in precision.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

By leveraging auxiliary data during training, these models can directly perform cross-category anomaly detection on target datasets, such as detecting defects on industrial product surfaces or identifying tumors in organ tissues. Existing approaches typically construct text prompts through either manual design or the optimization of learnable prompt vectors. However, these methods face several challenges: 1) handcrafted prompts require extensive expert knowledge and trial-and-error; 2) single-form learnable prompts struggle to capture complex anomaly semantics; and 3) an unconstrained prompt space limit generalization to unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning (Bayes-PFL), which models the prompt space as a learnable probability distribution from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, a prompt flow module is designed to learn both image-specific and image-agnostic distributions, which are jointly utilized to regularize the text prompt space and enhance the model's generalization on unseen categories. These learned distributions are then sampled to generate diverse text prompts, effectively covering the prompt space. Additionally, a residual cross-attention (RCA) module is introduced to better align dynamic text embeddings with fine-grained image features.

However, with the development of communication protocols, the visual data consumption volume of machines has gradually surpassed that of humans. For machines, the preference depends on downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection, rather than visual appeal. Considering the huge gap between human and machine visual systems, this paper proposes the topic: Image Quality Assessment for Machine Vision for the first time. Specifically, we (1) defined the subjective preferences of machines, including downstream tasks, test models, and evaluation metrics; (2) established the Machine Preference Database (MPD), which contains 2.25M fine-grained annotations and 30k reference/distorted image pair instances; (3) verified the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on MPD.

Specifically, there are two key issues: 1) current motion metrics do not fully align with human perceptions; 2) the existing motion prompts are limited. Based on these findings, we introduce VMBench--a comprehensive Video Motion Benchmark that has perception-aligned motion metrics and features the most diverse types of motion. VMBench has several appealing properties: 1) Perception-Driven Motion Evaluation Metrics, we identify five dimensions based on human perception in motion video assessment and develop fine-grained evaluation metrics, providing deeper insights into models' strengths and weaknesses in motion quality. 2) Meta-Guided Motion Prompt Generation, a structured method that extracts meta-information, generates diverse motion prompts with LLMs, and refines them through human-AI validation, resulting in a multi-level prompt library covering six key dynamic scene dimensions. 3) Human-Aligned Validation Mechanism, we provide human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks, with our metrics achieving an average 35.3% improvement in Spearman's correlation over baseline methods.

However, due to the lack of early and disease-specific symptoms, most patients with PDAC are diagnosed at an advanced disease stage. Consequently, early PDAC detection is crucial for improving patients' quality of life and expanding treatment options. In this work, we develop a coarse-to-fine approach to detect PDAC on contrast-enhanced CT scans. First, we localize and crop the region of interest from the low-resolution images, and then segment the PDAC-related structures at a finer scale. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further boost detection performance: (1) a data-splitting strategy for model ensembling, and (2) a customized post-processing function.

Traditional single-modality approaches often fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by radiological and pathological assessments. In this work, we introduce M4Survive (Multi-Modal Mamba Modeling for Survival Prediction), a novel framework that learns joint foundation model representations using efficient adapter networks. Our approach dynamically fuses heterogeneous embeddings from a foundation model repository (e.g., MedImageInsight, BiomedCLIP, Prov-GigaPath, UNI2-h), creating a correlated latent space optimized for survival risk estimation. By leveraging Mamba-based adapters, M4Survive enables efficient multi-modal learning while preserving computational efficiency.

In response, numerous encoding approaches have been proposed to capture the rich semantic information of point clouds. Yet, a critical limitation persists: a lack of consideration for colored point clouds which are more capable 3D representations as they contain diverse attributes: color and geometry. While existing methods handle these attributes separately on a per-point basis, this leads to a limited receptive field and restricted ability to capture relationships across multiple points. To address this, we pioneer a point cloud encoding methodology that leverages 3D Fourier decomposition to disentangle color and geometric features while extending the receptive field through spectral-domain operations. Our analysis confirms that this encoding approach effectively separates feature components, where the amplitude uniquely captures color attributes and the phase encodes geometric structure, thereby enabling independent learning and utilization of both attributes. Furthermore, the spectral-domain properties of these components naturally aggregate local features while considering multiple points' information. We validate our point cloud encoding approach on point cloud classification and style transfer tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the DensePoint dataset with improvements via a proposed amplitude-based data augmentation strategy.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Conventional attention operations either apply identical operation or employ non-identical operations across target dimensions. We identify that these approaches provide distinct perspectives on temporal information. To leverage the strengths of both operations, we propose a novel Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention (DTA) mechanism that integrates both identical/non-identical attention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to concentrate on both the correlation and dependency of temporal-channel using both identical and non-identical attention operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the DTA mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k) and dynamic dataset (CIFAR10-DVS), elevating spike representation and capturing complex temporal-channel relationship.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising framework for agent collaboration, but it faces difficulties in handling complex tasks and designing reward functions. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought stronger reasoning and cognitive abilities to MAS, but existing LLM-based systems struggle to respond quickly and accurately in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-based Graph Collaboration MARL (LGC-MARL), a framework that efficiently combines LLMs and MARL. This framework decomposes complex tasks into executable subtasks and achieves efficient collaboration among multiple agents through graph-based coordination. Specifically, LGC-MARL consists of two main components: an LLM planner and a graph-based collaboration meta policy. The LLM planner transforms complex task instructions into a series of executable subtasks, evaluates the rationality of these subtasks using a critic model, and generates an action dependency graph. The graph-based collaboration meta policy facilitates communication and collaboration among agents based on the action dependency graph, and adapts to new task environments through meta-learning. Experimental results on the AI2-THOR simulation platform demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of LGC-MARL in completing various complex tasks.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

However, commonly used units in SR, like convolutions and window-based Transformers, have limited receptive fields, making it challenging to apply them to improve SR under extremely limited computational cost. To address this issue, inspired by modeling convolution theorem through token mix, we propose a Fourier token-based plugin called FourierSR to improve SR uniformly, which avoids the instability or inefficiency of existing token mix technologies when applied as plug-ins. Furthermore, compared to convolutions and windows-based Transformers, our FourierSR only utilizes Fourier transform and multiplication operations, greatly reducing complexity while having global receptive fields. Experimental results show that our FourierSR as a plug-and-play unit brings an average PSNR gain of 0.34dB for existing efficient SR methods on Manga109 test set at the scale of x4, while the average increase in the number of Params and FLOPs is only 0.6% and 1.5% of original sizes.

However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Through systematic investigation, we discover this limitation stems from distributional biases rather than inherent model constraints. Our key insight reveals that while models fail on rare compositions when their inversions are common, they can successfully generate similar intermediate compositions (e.g., ""mouse chasing boy""). To test this hypothesis, we develop a Role-Bridging Decomposition framework that leverages these intermediates to gradually teach rare relationships without architectural modifications. We introduce ActionBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate action-based relationship generation across stereotypical and counter-stereotypical configurations. Our experiments validate that intermediate compositions indeed facilitate counter-stereotypical generation, with both automatic metrics and human evaluations showing significant improvements over existing approaches.

However, it faces significant challenges when dealing with domain shifts, especially when each client has access only to its source data and cannot share it during target domain adaptation. Moreover, FL methods often require high communication overhead due to multiple rounds of model updates between clients and the server. We propose a one-shot Federated Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FUDA) method to address these limitations. Specifically, we introduce Scaled Entropy Attention (SEA) for model aggregation and Multi-Source Pseudo Labeling (MSPL) for target domain adaptation. SEA uses scaled prediction entropy on target domain to assign higher attention to reliable models. This improves the global model quality and ensures balanced weighting of contributions. MSPL distills knowledge from multiple source models to generate pseudo labels and manage noisy labels using smoothed soft-label cross-entropy (SSCE).

This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching.
To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite).

To address this problem while keeping the simplicity of a regular grid structure, our approach builds upon the standard grid-based paradigm by constructing multiple elementary metric grids as high-order terms to approximate complex nonlinearities, following the Taylor expansion principle. Furthermore, we enhance model compactness with hash encoding based on different sparsities of the grids to prevent detrimental hash collisions, and a high-order extrapolation decoder to reduce explicit grid storage requirements. experimental results on both 2D and 3D reconstructions demonstrate the superior fitting and rendering accuracy of the proposed method across diverse signal types, validating its robustness and generalizability.

However, this mechanism has notable drawbacks: 1) setting the reasonable threshold is an open problem which significantly influences the selection of the high-quality pseudo-labels; and 2) deep models often exhibit the over-confidence phenomenon which makes the confidence value an unreliable indicator for assessing the quality of pseudo-labels due to the scarcity of labeled data. In this paper, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Ensemble Structure (UES) to assess the utility of pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples. We further model the utility of pseudo-labels as long-tailed weights to avoid the open problem of setting the threshold. Concretely, the advantage of the long-tailed weights ensures that even unreliable pseudo-labels still contribute to enhancing the model's robustness. Besides, UES is lightweight and architecture-agnostic, easily extending to various computer vision tasks, including classification and regression. Experimental results demonstrate that combining the proposed method with DualPose leads to a 3.47% improvement in Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) on the Sniffing dataset with 100 data points (30 labeled), a 7.29\% improvement in PCK on the FLIC dataset with 100 data points (50 labeled), and a 3.91% improvement in PCK on the LSP dataset with 200 data points (100 labeled).

Due to the unavailability of target-domain data, some methods leverage the multimodal capabilities of vision-language models, using textual prompts to estimate cross-domain information, enhancing the model's generalization capability. These methods typically use a single textual prompt, often referred to as the one-step prompt method. However, when dealing with complex styles such as the combination of rain and night, we observe that the performance of the one-step prompt method tends to be relatively weak. The reason may be that many scenes incorporate not just a single style but a combination of multiple styles. The one-step prompt method may not effectively synthesize combined information involving various styles. To address this limitation, we propose a new method, i.e., Style Evolving along Chain-of-Thought, which aims to progressively integrate and expand style information along the chain of thought, enabling the continual evolution of styles. Specifically, by progressively refining style descriptions and guiding the diverse evolution of styles, this approach enables more accurate simulation of various style characteristics and helps the model gradually learn and adapt to subtle differences between styles. Additionally, it exposes the model to a broader range of style features with different data distributions, thereby enhancing its generalization capability in unseen domains.

Recent works handle this problem by leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to describe pedestrian images automatically. However, the captions produced by MLLMs lack diversity in description styles. To address this issue, we propose a Human Annotator Modeling (HAM) approach to enable MLLMs to mimic the description styles of thousands of human annotators. Specifically, we first extract style features from human textual descriptions and perform clustering on them. This allows us to group textual descriptions with similar styles into the same cluster. Then, we employ a prompt to represent each of these clusters and apply prompt learning to mimic the description styles of different human annotators. Furthermore, we define a style feature space and perform uniform sampling in this space to obtain more diverse clustering prototypes, which further enriches the diversity of the MLLM-generated captions. Finally, we adopt HAM to automatically annotate a massive-scale database for text-to-image ReID.

In this paper, we propose a novel target-aware Bidirectional Fusion transformer (BFTrans) for UAV tracking. Specifically, we first present a two-stream fusion network based on linear self and cross attentions, which can combine the shallow and the deep features from both forward and backward directions, providing the adjusted local details for location and global semantics for recognition. Besides, a target-aware positional encoding strategy is designed for the above fusion model, which is helpful to perceive the object-related attributes during the fusion phase.

Massive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can exceed other state-of-the-art trackers and run with an average speed of 30.5 FPS on embedded platform, which is appropriate for practical drone deployments.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

To address these challenges, we propose Cosh-DiT, a Co-speech gesture video system with hybrid Diffusion Transformers that perform audio-to-motion and motion-to-video synthesis using discrete and continuous diffusion modeling, respectively. First, we introduce an audio Diffusion Transformer (Cosh-DiT-A) to synthesize expressive gesture dynamics synchronized with speech rhythms. To capture upper body, facial, and hand movement priors, we employ vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) to jointly learn their dependencies within a discrete latent space. Then, for realistic video synthesis conditioned on the generated speech-driven motion, we design a visual Diffusion Transformer (Cosh-DiT-V) that effectively integrates spatial and temporal contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently generates lifelike videos with expressive facial expressions and natural, smooth gestures that align seamlessly with speech.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

By performing occupancy prediction of the 3D space in the environment, the ability and robustness of scene understanding can be effectively improved. However, existing occupancy prediction tasks are primarily modeled using voxel or point cloud-based approaches: voxel-based network structures often suffer from the loss of spatial information due to the voxelization process, while point cloud-based methods, although better at retaining spatial location information, face limitations in representing volumetric structural details. To address this issue, we propose a dual-modal prediction method based on 3D Gaussian sets and sparse points, which balances both spatial location and volumetric structural information, achieving higher accuracy in semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, our method adopts a Transformer-based architecture, taking 3D Gaussian sets, sparse points, and queries as inputs. Through the multi-layer structure of the Transformer, the enhanced queries and 3D Gaussian sets jointly contribute to the semantic occupancy prediction, and an adaptive fusion mechanism integrates the semantic outputs of both modalities to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, to further improve accuracy, we dynamically refine the point cloud at each layer, allowing for more precise location information during occupancy prediction. We conducted experiments on the Occ3DnuScenes dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method on IoU based metrics.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

However, the scarcity of training data impedes progress in this field. This paper introduces PanoGen++, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by generating varied and pertinent panoramic environments for VLN tasks. PanoGen++ incorporates pre-trained diffusion models with domain-specific fine-tuning, employing parameter-efficient techniques such as low-rank adaptation to minimize computational costs. We investigate two settings for environment generation: masked image inpainting and recursive image outpainting. The former maximizes novel environment creation by inpainting masked regions based on textual descriptions, while the latter facilitates agents' learning of spatial relationships within panoramas. Empirical evaluations on room-to-room (R2R), room-for-room (R4R), and cooperative vision-and-dialog navigation (CVDN) datasets reveal significant performance enhancements: a 2.44% increase in success rate on the R2R test leaderboard, a 0.63% improvement on the R4R validation unseen set, and a 0.75-meter enhancement in goal progress on the CVDN validation unseen set.

Our approach introduces a novel framework aimed at enhancing continuous emotion recognition. This is achieved by fine-tuning the CLIP model with the aff-wild2 dataset, which provides annotated expression labels. The result is a fine-tuned model that serves as an efficient visual feature extractor, significantly improving its robustness. To further boost the performance of continuous emotion recognition, we incorporate Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules alongside Transformer Encoder modules into our system architecture. The integration of these advanced components allows our model to outperform baseline performance, demonstrating its ability to recognize human emotions with greater accuracy and efficiency.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.09926,VideoMerge: Towards Training-free Long Video Generation,"Siyang Zhang, Harry Yang, Ser-Nam Lim","Long video generation remains a challenging and compelling topic in computer vision. Diffusion based models, among the various approaches to video generation, have achieved state of the art quality with their iterative denoising procedures. However, the intrinsic complexity of the video domain renders the training of such diffusion models exceedingly expensive in terms of both data curation and computational resources. Moreover, these models typically operate on a fixed noise tensor that represents the video, resulting in predetermined spatial and temporal dimensions. Although several high quality open-source pretrained video diffusion models, jointly trained on images and videos of varying lengths and resolutions, are available, it is generally not recommended to specify a video length at inference that was not included in the training set. Consequently, these models are not readily adaptable to the direct generation of longer videos by merely increasing the specified video length. In addition to feasibility challenges, long-video generation also encounters quality issues. The domain of long videos is inherently more complex than that of short videos: extended durations introduce greater variability and necessitate long-range temporal consistency, thereby increasing the overall difficulty of the task. We propose VideoMerge, a training-free method that can be seamlessly adapted to merge short videos generated by pretrained text-to-video diffusion model. Our approach preserves the model's original expressiveness and consistency while allowing for extended duration and dynamic variation as specified by the user. By leveraging the strengths of pretrained models, our method addresses challenges related to smoothness, consistency, and dynamic content through orthogonal strategies that operate collaboratively to achieve superior quality.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Wozniak, Marvin Klingner, Camille Maurice, B Ravi Kiran, Senthil Yogamani","Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINO have led to a paradigm shift in 2D camera-based perception towards extracting generalized features to support many downstream tasks. Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy",12/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Nasrabadi, Raghuveer Rao","In automatic target recognition (ATR) systems, sensors may fail to capture discriminative, fine-grained detail features due to environmental conditions, noise created by CMOS chips, occlusion, parallaxes, and sensor misalignment. Therefore, multi-sensor image fusion is an effective choice to overcome these constraints. However, multi-modal image sensors are heterogeneous and have domain and granularity gaps. In addition, the multi-sensor images can be misaligned due to intricate background clutters, fluctuating illumination conditions, and uncontrolled sensor settings. In this paper, to overcome these issues, we decompose, align, and fuse multiple image sensor data for target classification. We extract the domain-specific and domain-invariant features from each sensor data. We propose to develop a shared unified discrete token (UDT) space between sensors to reduce the domain and granularity gaps. Additionally, we develop an alignment module to overcome the misalignment between multi-sensors and emphasize the discriminative representation of the UDT space. In the alignment module, we introduce sparsity constraints to provide a better cross-modal representation of the UDT space and robustness against various sensor settings. We achieve superior classification performance compared to single-modality classifiers and several state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion algorithms on four multi-sensor ATR datasets.",12/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation.

Traditional approaches rely on slot-based bottlenecks to learn object properties explicitly, while recent self-supervised vision models like DINO have shown emergent object understanding. However, DINO representations primarily capture global scene features, often confounding individual object attributes. We investigate the effectiveness of DINO representations and slot-based methods for multi-object instance retrieval. Our findings reveal that DINO representations excel at capturing global object attributes such as object shape and size, but struggle with object-level details like colour, whereas slot-based representations struggle at both global and object-level understanding. To address this, we propose a method that combines global and local features by augmenting DINO representations with object-centric latent vectors from a Variational Autoencoder trained on segmented image patches that are extracted from the DINO features. This approach improves multi-object instance retrieval performance, bridging the gap between global scene understanding and fine-grained object representation without requiring full model retraining.",12/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

The advancement of deep learning has facilitated the creation of numerous medical datasets with diverse expert-level annotations. Aggregating these datasets can maximize data utilization and address the inadequacy of labeled data. However, the heterogeneity of expert-level annotations across tasks such as classification, localization, and segmentation presents a significant challenge for learning from these datasets. To this end, we introduce nFoundation X, an end-to-end framework that utilizes diverse expert-level annotations from numerous public datasets to train a foundation model capable of multiple tasks including classification, localization, and segmentation. To address the challenges of annotation and task heterogeneity, we propose a Lock-Release pretraining strategy to enhance the cyclic learning from multiple datasets, combined with the student-teacher learning paradigm, ensuring the model retains general knowledge for all tasks while preventing overfitting to any single task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Foundation X, we trained a model using 11 chest X-ray datasets, covering annotations for classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Our experimental results show that Foundation X achieves notable performance gains through extensive annotation utilization, excels in cross-dataset and cross-task learning, and further enhances performance in organ localization and segmentation tasks.

Our findings reveal that these models lack comprehension of multiple image-level augmentations. To facilitate this study, we created an augmented version of the Flickr8k dataset, pairing each image with a detailed description of the applied transformation.

Although recent studies make efforts to improve generative quality by aligning denoising process across original and higher resolutions, the root cause of suboptimal generation is still lacking exploration. Through comprehensive analysis of position encoding in U-Net, we attribute it to inconsistent position encoding, sourced by the inadequate propagation of position information from zero-padding to latent features in convolution layers as resolution increases. To address this issue, we propose a novel training-free approach, introducing a Progressive Boundary Complement (PBC) method. This method creates dynamic virtual image boundaries inside the feature map to enhance position information propagation, enabling high-quality and rich-content high-resolution image synthesis.

Most methods address this by resampling images, leading to either information loss or computational inefficiencies. While solutions exist for specific tasks, no unified approach has been proposed. We introduce a resolution-invariant autoencoder that adapts spatial resizing at each layer in the network via a learned variable resizing process, replacing fixed spatial down/upsampling at the traditional factor of 2. This ensures a consistent latent space resolution, regardless of input or output resolution. Our model enables various downstream tasks to be performed on an image latent whilst maintaining performance across different resolutions, overcoming the shortfalls of traditional methods.

However, applying ViTs to multi-channel imaging (MCI) data, e.g., for medical and remote sensing applications, remains a challenge. In particular, MCI data often consist of layers acquired from different modalities. Directly training ViTs on such data can obscure complementary information and impair the performance. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective pretraining framework for large-scale MCI datasets. Our method, named Isolated Channel ViT (IC-ViT), patchifies image channels individually and thereby enables pretraining for multimodal multi-channel tasks. We show that this channel-wise patchifying is a key technique for MCI processing. More importantly, one can pretrain the IC-ViT on single channels and finetune it on downstream multi-channel datasets. This pretraining framework captures dependencies between patches as well as channels and produces robust feature representation. Experiments on various tasks and benchmarks, including JUMP-CP and CHAMMI for cell microscopy imaging, and So2Sat-LCZ42 for satellite imaging, show that the proposed IC-ViT delivers 4-14 percentage points of performance improvement over existing channel-adaptive approaches.

However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results.

(Semi-)Automated safety analysis methods extract road user trajectories to compute safety indicators, for example, Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Post-encroachment Time (PET). Inspired by the success of deep learning in MOD and MOT, we investigate three MOT methods, including one based on a stereo-camera, using the annotated KITTI traffic video dataset. Two post-processing steps, IDsplit and SS, are developed to improve the tracking results and investigate the factors influencing the TTC. The experimental results show that, despite some advantages in terms of the numbers of interactions or similarity to the TTC distributions, all the tested methods systematically over-estimate the number of interactions and under-estimate the TTC: they report more interactions and more severe interactions, making the road user interactions appear less safe than they are.

Multiple Choice Learning is a technique for generating multiple masks, through multiple learned prediction heads. However, this cannot readily be extended to producing more outputs than its initial pre-training hyperparameters, as the sparse, winner-takes-all loss function makes it easy for one prediction head to become overly dominant, thus not guaranteeing the clinical relevancy of each mask produced. We introduce SeqSAM, a sequential, RNN-inspired approach to generating multiple masks, which uses a bipartite matching loss for ensuring the clinical relevancy of each mask, and can produce an arbitrary number of masks.

Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a challenge. In this paper, we aim to address these questions by introducing BiasConnect, a novel tool designed to analyze and quantify bias interactions in TTI models. Our approach leverages a counterfactual-based framework to generate pairwise causal graphs that reveals the underlying structure of bias interactions for the given text prompt. Additionally, our method provides empirical estimates that indicate how other bias dimensions shift toward or away from an ideal distribution when a given bias is modified. Our estimates have a strong correlation (+0.69) with the interdependency observations post bias mitigation.

Bowyer","In Daugman-style iris recognition, the textures of the left and right irises of the same person are traditionally considered as being as different as the irises of two unrelated persons. However, previous research indicates that humans can detect that two iris images are from different eyes of the same person, or eyes of monozygotic twins, with an accuracy of about 80%. In this work, we employ a Siamese network architecture and contrastive learning to categorize a pair of iris images as coming from monozygotic or non-monozygotic irises. This could potentially be applied, for example, as a fast, noninvasive test to determine if twins are monozygotic or non-monozygotic. We construct a dataset comprising both synthetic monozygotic pairs (images of different irises of the same individual) and natural monozygotic pairs (images of different images from persons who are identical twins), in addition to non-monozygotic pairs from unrelated individuals, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities. To gain deeper insights into the learned representations, we train and analyze three variants of the model using (1) the original input images, (2) iris-only images, and (3) non-iris-only images. This comparison reveals the critical importance of iris-specific textural details and contextual ocular cues in identifying monozygotic iris patterns. The results demonstrate that models leveraging full eye-region information outperform those trained solely on iris-only data, emphasizing the nuanced interplay between iris and ocular characteristics. Our approach achieves accuracy levels using the full iris image that exceed those previously reported for human classification of monozygotic iris pairs. This study presents the first classifier designed to determine whether a pair of iris images originates from monozygotic individuals.",12/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.09733,I2V3D: Controllable image-to-video generation with 3D guidance,"Zhiyuan Zhang, Dongdong Chen, Jing Liao","We present I2V3D, a novel framework for animating static images into dynamic videos with precise 3D control, leveraging the strengths of both 3D geometry guidance and advanced generative models. Our approach combines the precision of a computer graphics pipeline, enabling accurate control over elements such as camera movement, object rotation, and character animation, with the visual fidelity of generative AI to produce high-quality videos from coarsely rendered inputs. To support animations with any initial start point and extended sequences, we adopt a two-stage generation process guided by 3D geometry: 1) 3D-Guided Keyframe Generation, where a customized image diffusion model refines rendered keyframes to ensure consistency and quality, and 2) 3D-Guided Video Interpolation, a training-free approach that generates smooth, high-quality video frames between keyframes using bidirectional guidance. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in producing controllable, high-quality animations from single input images by harmonizing 3D geometry with generative models. The code for our framework will be publicly released.",12/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.09675,Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence,"Shangwen Zhu, Han Zhang, Zhantao Yang, Qianyu Peng, Zhao Pu, Huangji Wang, Fan Cheng","Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.",12/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.09669,Silent Branding Attack: Trigger-free Data Poisoning Attack on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Sangwon Jang, June Suk Choi, Jaehyeong Jo, Kimin Lee, Sung Ju Hwang","Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality contents from text prompts. However, their reliance on publicly available data and the growing trend of data sharing for fine-tuning make these models particularly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce the Silent Branding Attack, a novel data poisoning method that manipulates text-to-image diffusion models to generate images containing specific brand logos or symbols without any text triggers. We find that when certain visual patterns are repeatedly in the training data, the model learns to reproduce them naturally in its outputs, even without prompt mentions. Leveraging this, we develop an automated data poisoning algorithm that unobtrusively injects logos into original images, ensuring they blend naturally and remain undetected. Models trained on this poisoned dataset generate images containing logos without degrading image quality or text alignment. We experimentally validate our silent branding attack across two realistic settings on large-scale high-quality image datasets and style personalization datasets, achieving high success rates even without a specific text trigger. Human evaluation and quantitative metrics including logo detection show that our method can stealthily embed logos.",12/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Previous studies have typically focused on either enhancing the visual quality of synthesized images at the expense of sampling efficiency or dramatically accelerating sampling without improving the base model's generative capacity. Moreover, nearly all inference methods have not been able to ensure stable performance simultaneously on both diffusion models (DMs) and visual autoregressive models (ARMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel plug-and-play inference paradigm, CoRe^2, which comprises three subprocesses: Collect, Reflect, and Refine. CoRe^2 first collects classifier-free guidance (CFG) trajectories, and then use collected data to train a weak model that reflects the easy-to-learn contents while reducing number of function evaluations during inference by half. Subsequently, CoRe^2 employs weak-to-strong guidance to refine the conditional output, thereby improving the model's capacity to generate high-frequency and realistic content, which is difficult for the base model to capture. To the best of our knowledge, CoRe^2 is the first to demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness across a wide range of DMs, including SDXL, SD3.5, and FLUX, as well as ARMs like LlamaGen. It has exhibited significant performance improvements on HPD v2, Pick-of-Pic, Drawbench, GenEval, and T2I-Compbench. Furthermore, CoRe^2 can be seamlessly integrated with the state-of-the-art Z-Sampling, outperforming it by 0.3 and 0.16 on PickScore and AES, while achieving 5.64s time saving using this http URL is released at this https URL.",12/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10637,Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models,"Rohit Gandikota, David Bau","Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10636,The Curse of Conditions: Analyzing and Improving Optimal Transport for Conditional Flow-Based Generation,"Ho Kei Cheng, Alexander Schwing","Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching. This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets. Code is available at this https URL",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Navigating so many models requires an atlas, but as most models are poorly documented charting such an atlas is challenging. To explore the hidden potential of model repositories, we chart a preliminary atlas representing the documented fraction of Hugging Face. It provides stunning visualizations of the model landscape and evolution. We demonstrate several applications of this atlas including predicting model attributes (e.g., accuracy), and analyzing trends in computer vision models. However, as the current atlas remains incomplete, we propose a method for charting undocumented regions. Specifically, we identify high-confidence structural priors based on dominant real-world model training practices. Leveraging these priors, our approach enables accurate mapping of previously undocumented areas of the atlas. We publicly release our datasets, code, and interactive atlas.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10632,Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention: Is Learnable Attention Better For Vision Transformers?,"Subhajit Maity, Killian Hitsman, Xin Li, Aritra Dutta","Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Although KANs are useful in finding symbolic representations and continual learning of one-dimensional functions, their effectiveness in diverse machine learning (ML) tasks, such as vision, remains questionable. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep network architectures, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we are the first to design a general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for vanilla ViTs that can operate on any choice of basis. However, the computing and memory costs of training them motivated us to propose a more modular version, and we designed particular learnable attention, called Fourier-KArAt. Fourier-KArAt and its variants either outperform their ViT counterparts or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We dissect these architectures' performance and generalization capacity by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and spectral behavior, and contrast them with vanilla ViTs. The goal of this paper is not to produce parameter- and compute-efficient attention, but to encourage the community to explore KANs in conjunction with more advanced architectures that require a careful understanding of learnable activations.

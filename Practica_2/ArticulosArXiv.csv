10.48550./arXiv.2503.10639,GoT: Unleashing Reasoning Capability of Multimodal Large Language Model for Visual Generation and Editing,"Rongyao Fang, Chengqi Duan, Kun Wang, Linjiang Huang, Hao Li, Shilin Yan, Hao Tian, Xingyu Zeng, Rui Zhao, Jifeng Dai, Xihui Liu, Hongsheng Li","Current image generation and editing methods primarily process textual prompts as direct inputs without reasoning about visual composition and explicit operations. We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at this https URL.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10638,Studying Classifier(-Free) Guidance From a Classifier-Centric Perspective,"Xiaoming Zhao, Alexander G. Schwing","Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10635,A Frustratingly Simple Yet Highly Effective Attack Baseline: Over 90% Success Rate Against the Strong Black-box Models of GPT-4.5/4o/o1,"Zhaoyi Li, Xiaohan Zhao, Dong-Dong Wu, Jiacheng Cui, Zhiqiang Shen","Despite promising performance on open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs), transfer-based targeted attacks often fail against black-box commercial LVLMs. Analyzing failed adversarial perturbations reveals that the learned perturbations typically originate from a uniform distribution and lack clear semantic details, resulting in unintended responses. This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core semantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets and methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective solution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10634,V2Edit: Versatile Video Diffusion Editor for Videos and 3D Scenes,"Yanming Zhang, Jun-Kun Chen, Jipeng Lyu, Yu-Xiong Wang","This paper introduces V$^2$Edit, a novel training-free framework for instruction-guided video and 3D scene editing. Addressing the critical challenge of balancing original content preservation with editing task fulfillment, our approach employs a progressive strategy that decomposes complex editing tasks into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Each subtask is controlled through three key synergistic mechanisms: the initial noise, noise added at each denoising step, and cross-attention maps between text prompts and video content. This ensures robust preservation of original video elements while effectively applying the desired edits. Beyond its native video editing capability, we extend V$^2$Edit to 3D scene editing via a ""render-edit-reconstruct"" process, enabling high-quality, 3D-consistent edits even for tasks involving substantial geometric changes such as object insertion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V$^2$Edit achieves high-quality and successful edits across various challenging video editing tasks and complex 3D scene editing tasks, thereby establishing state-of-the-art performance in both domains.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10631,HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model,"Jiaming Liu, Hao Chen, Pengju An, Zhuoyang Liu, Renrui Zhang, Chenyang Gu, Xiaoqi Li, Ziyu Guo, Sixiang Chen, Mengzhen Liu, Chengkai Hou, Mengdi Zhao, KC alex Zhou, Pheng-Ann Heng, Shanghang Zhang","Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10630,UniGoal: Towards Universal Zero-shot Goal-oriented Navigation,"Hang Yin, Xiuwei Xu, Lingqing Zhao, Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu","In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10629,Hierarchical Self-Supervised Adversarial Training for Robust Vision Models in Histopathology,"Hashmat Shadab Malik, Shahina Kunhimon, Muzammal Naseer, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Salman Khan","Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges for vision models in critical fields like healthcare, where reliability is essential. Although adversarial training has been well studied in natural images, its application to biomedical and microscopy data remains limited. Existing self-supervised adversarial training methods overlook the hierarchical structure of histopathology images, where patient-slide-patch relationships provide valuable discriminative signals. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Adversarial Training (HSAT), which exploits these properties to craft adversarial examples using multi-level contrastive learning and integrate it into adversarial training for enhanced robustness. We evaluate HSAT on multiclass histopathology dataset OpenSRH and the results show that HSAT outperforms existing methods from both biomedical and natural image domains. HSAT enhances robustness, achieving an average gain of 54.31% in the white-box setting and reducing performance drops to 3-4% in the black-box setting, compared to 25-30% for the baseline. These results set a new benchmark for adversarial training in this domain, paving the way for more robust models.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10627,SciVerse: Unveiling the Knowledge Comprehension and Visual Reasoning of LMMs on Multi-modal Scientific Problems,"Ziyu Guo, Ray Zhang, Hao Chen, Jialin Gao, Dongzhi Jiang, Jiaze Wang, Pheng-Ann Heng","The rapid advancement of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled their application in scientific problem-solving, yet their fine-grained capabilities remain under-explored. In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10626,NIL: No-data Imitation Learning by Leveraging Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models,"Mert Albaba, Chenhao Li, Markos Diomataris, Omid Taheri, Andreas Krause, Michael Black","Acquiring physically plausible motor skills across diverse and unconventional morphologies-including humanoid robots, quadrupeds, and animals-is essential for advancing character simulation and robotics. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations, which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data generation for imitation learning.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10625,LHM: Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model from a Single Image in Seconds,"Lingteng Qiu, Xiaodong Gu, Peihao Li, Qi Zuo, Weichao Shen, Junfei Zhang, Kejie Qiu, Weihao Yuan, Guanying Chen, Zilong Dong, Liefeng Bo","Animatable 3D human reconstruction from a single image is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity in decoupling geometry, appearance, and deformation. Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10624,ETCH: Generalizing Body Fitting to Clothed Humans via Equivariant Tightness,"Boqian Li, Haiwen Feng, Zeyu Cai, Michael J. Black, Yuliang Xiu","Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings. Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics.

One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model.

We evaluate a range of DiT-based architectures--including PixArt-style and MMDiT variants--and compare them with a standard DiT variant which directly processes concatenated text and noise inputs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that the performance of standard DiT is comparable with those specialized models, while demonstrating superior parameter-efficiency, especially when scaled up. Leveraging the layer-wise parameter sharing strategy, we achieve a further reduction of 66% in model size compared to an MMDiT architecture, with minimal performance impact. Building on an in-depth analysis of critical components such as text encoders and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we introduce DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite.

However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance.

However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities.

Recent advancements in LoRA-based (Low-Rank Adaptation) methods have shown promise in effectively capturing the style of a single image. However, these approaches still face significant challenges such as content inconsistency, style misalignment, and content leakage. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the limitations of the standard diffusion parameterization, which learns to predict noise, in the context of style transfer. To address these issues, we introduce ConsisLoRA, a LoRA-based method that enhances both content and style consistency by optimizing the LoRA weights to predict the original image rather than noise. We also propose a two-step training strategy that decouples the learning of content and style from the reference image. To effectively capture both the global structure and local details of the content image, we introduce a stepwise loss transition strategy. Additionally, we present an inference guidance method that enables continuous control over content and style strengths during inference.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10613,CoSTA$\ast$: Cost-Sensitive Toolpath Agent for Multi-turn Image Editing,"Advait Gupta, NandaKiran Velaga, Dang Nguyen, Tianyi Zhou","Text-to-image models like stable diffusion and DALLE-3 still struggle with multi-turn image editing. We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose a three-stage approach ""CoSTA*"" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off. We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training. Current methods often overlook uncertainties arising from adversarial conditions or distributional shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation under various camera corruption scenarios, such as fog or missing cameras, demonstrates that our approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty by assigning higher uncertainty values to unseen data.

To address the limitations of existing methods in insufficient exploitation of modal synergistic effects, noise sensitivity, and limited fine-grained alignment capabilities, this paper proposes a dual-stage cross-modal alignment framework. First, we construct vision-text and audio-text contrastive learning networks based on an improved CLIP architecture, achieving preliminary alignment in the feature space through modality-decoupled pre-training. Subsequently, we design a temporal-aware dynamic fusion module that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and gated bidirectional LSTM to respectively capture the macro-evolution patterns of facial expressions and local dynamics of acoustic features. Innovatively, we introduce a quality-guided modality fusion strategy that enables modality compensation under occlusion and noisy scenarios through differentiable weight allocation. Experimental results on the Hume-Vidmimic2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.35 across six emotion dimensions, outperforming the best baseline by 40\%.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the ""overall truthfulness"" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as ""per-token"" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist ""generic truthful directions"" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks.

We take an approach that progressively expands the generation of dynamic scenes -- first enhancing dynamic content within individual video clip, then extending this capability to create seamless explorations across broad viewpoint ranges. Specifically, we construct a dataset featuring a large degree of dynamics with camera parameter annotations for training while designing a lightweight camera injection module and training scheme to preserve dynamics of the pretrained models. Building on these improved single-clip techniques, we enable extended scene exploration by allowing users to iteratively specify camera trajectories for generating coherent video sequences. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that CameraCtrl Ii enables camera-controlled dynamic scene synthesis with substantially wider spatial exploration than previous approaches.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

In this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain. Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath (55.7%).

A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10568,Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding,"Haopeng Li, Jinyue Yang, Guoqi Li, Huan Wang","We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.94 with only 64 sampling steps, achieving over a 20-fold increase in throughput while reducing memory consumption by over 75% compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

To counteract, various anti-facial recognition techniques have been proposed for privacy protection by adversarially perturbing face images, among which generative makeup-based approaches are the most popular. However, these methods, designed primarily to impersonate specific target identities, can only achieve weak dodging success rates while increasing the risk of targeted abuse. In addition, they often introduce global visual artifacts or a lack of adaptability to accommodate diverse makeup prompts, compromising user satisfaction. To address the above limitations, we develop MASQUE, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates localized adversarial makeups guided by user-defined text prompts. Built upon precise null-text inversion, customized cross-attention fusion with masking, and a pairwise adversarial guidance mechanism using images of the same individual, MASQUE achieves robust dodging performance without requiring any external identity. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source facial recognition models and commercial APIs demonstrate that MASQUE significantly improves dodging success rates over all baselines, along with higher perceptual fidelity and stronger adaptability to various text makeup prompts.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Given any deep vision model that uses a fully connected layer as the output head, VisionLogic transforms neurons in the last layer into predicates and grounds them into vision concepts using causal validation. In this way, VisionLogic can provide local explanations for single images and global explanations for specific classes in the form of logic rules. Compared to existing interpretable visualization tools such as saliency maps, VisionLogic addresses several key challenges, including the lack of causal explanations, overconfidence in visualizations, and ambiguity in interpretation. VisionLogic also facilitates the study of visual concepts encoded by predicates, particularly how they behave under perturbation -- an area that remains underexplored in the field of hidden semantics. Apart from providing better visual explanations and insights into the visual concepts learned by the model, we show that VisionLogic retains most of the neural network's discriminative power in an interpretable and transparent manner. We envision it as a bridge between complex model behavior and human-understandable explanations, providing trustworthy and actionable insights for real-world applications.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce a three-level MLP-Mixer module, which processes spatial features at multiple resolutions while maintaining structural integrity. Experimental results on the ABAW 8th competition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in affective behavior analysis.

However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets. Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps. To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics. We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information. By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation. We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA. Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels. Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively.

Despite significant advancements with models like CLIP that align cross-modal representations, a persistent challenge remains: the hubness problem, where a small subset of samples (hubs) dominate as nearest neighbors, leading to biased representations and degraded retrieval accuracy. Existing methods often mitigate hubness through post-hoc normalization techniques, relying on prior data distributions that may not be practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we directly mitigate hubness during training and introduce NeighborRetr, a novel method that effectively balances the learning of hubs and adaptively adjusts the relations of various kinds of neighbors. Our approach not only mitigates the hubness problem but also enhances retrieval performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple cross-modal retrieval benchmarks.

The audio branches employ pre-trained VGG models to extract VGGish and LogMel features from speech signals. These features undergo temporal modeling using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). We then apply cross-modal attention mechanisms, where visual features interact with audio features through query-key-value attention structures. Finally, the features are concatenated and passed through a regression layer to predict valence and arousal.

This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting.

In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to anomaly detection, termed Hoi2Anomaly, which aims to achieve precise discrimination and localization of anomalies. The proposed methodology involves the construction of a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset comprising human-object interaction (HOI) pairs in anomalous scenarios. Second, we have trained an HOI extractor in threat scenarios to localize and match anomalous actions and entities. Finally, explanatory content is generated for the detected anomalous HOI by fine-tuning the visual language pretraining (VLP) framework.

Existing training-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but require costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain performance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal that the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the accelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight introduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to maintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this finding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token compression framework. The first stage employs an Information-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune low-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide token merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10.

Recent development either relies on correspondence priors for regularization or uses off-the-shelf flow estimators to derive analytical poses. However, the potential for jointly learning scene geometry, camera poses, and dense flow within a unified neural representation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Flow-NeRF, a unified framework that simultaneously optimizes scene geometry, camera poses, and dense optical flow all on-the-fly. To enable the learning of dense flow within the neural radiance field, we design and build a bijective mapping for flow estimation, conditioned on pose. To make the scene reconstruction benefit from the flow estimation, we develop an effective feature enhancement mechanism to pass canonical space features to world space representations, significantly enhancing scene geometry. We validate our model across four important tasks, i.e., novel view synthesis, depth estimation, camera pose prediction, and dense optical flow estimation, using several datasets.

Replacing human observers by computer vision lowers the cost of data collection and therefore allows to collect more extensive datasets. However, the majority of available computer vision algorithms to study animal behaviour is highly tailored towards a single research objective, limiting possibilities for data reuse. In this perspective, pose-estimation in combination with animal tracking offers opportunities to yield a higher level representation capturing both the spatial and temporal component of animal behaviour. Such a higher level representation allows to answer a wide variety of research questions simultaneously, without the need to develop repeatedly tailored computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we therefore first cope with several weaknesses of current pose-estimation algorithms and thereafter introduce KeySORT (Keypoint Simple and Online Realtime Tracking). KeySORT deploys an adaptive Kalman filter to construct tracklets in a bounding-box free manner, significantly improving the temporal consistency of detected keypoints. In this paper, we focus on pose estimation in cattle, but our methodology can easily be generalised to any other animal species. Our test results indicate our algorithm is able to detect up to 80% of the ground truth keypoints with high accuracy, with only a limited drop in performance when daylight recordings are compared to nightvision recordings.

To enhance generalization, we tailor our model to the problem setting by (1) independent image encoding, (2) antisymmetric logit space equivariance, and (3) ordinal scale awareness.

Bagdanov","Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to learn from a sequence of tasks without having access to previous task data. In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, resulting in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to consolidate feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks and employs prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our approach, which we call Elastic Feature Consolidation++ (EFC++) exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on a proposed Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes. In addition, we introduce a post-training prototype re-balancing phase that updates classifiers to compensate for feature drift.

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Efficient and accurate medical waste classification is crucial for mitigating these risks. We explore the integration of capsule networks with a pretrained DenseNet model to improve medical waste classification. To the best of our knowledge, capsule networks have not yet been applied to this task, making this study the first to assess their effectiveness.
A diverse dataset of medical waste images collected from multiple public sources, is used to evaluate three model configurations: (1) a pretrained DenseNet model as a baseline, (2) a pretrained DenseNet with frozen layers combined with a capsule network, and (3) a pretrained DenseNet with unfrozen layers combined with a capsule network. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating capsule networks improves classification performance, with F1 scores increasing from 0.89 (baseline) to 0.92 (hybrid model with unfrozen layers). This highlights the potential of capsule networks to address the spatial limitations of traditional convolutional models and improve classification robustness.
While the capsule-enhanced model demonstrated improved classification performance, direct comparisons with prior studies were challenging due to differences in dataset size and diversity. Previous studies relied on smaller, domain-specific datasets, which inherently yielded higher accuracy. In contrast, our study employs a significantly larger and more diverse dataset, leading to better generalization but introducing additional classification challenges.

The previous nuclei segmentation and classification models require splitting large images into smaller patches for training, leading to two significant issues. First, nuclei at the borders of adjacent patches often misalign during inference. Second, this patch-based approach significantly increases the model's training and inference time. Recently, Mamba has garnered attention for its ability to model large-scale images with linear time complexity and low memory consumption. It offers a promising solution for training nuclei segmentation and classification models on full-sized images. However, the Mamba orientation-based scanning method lacks account for category-specific features, resulting in sub-optimal performance in scenarios with imbalanced class distributions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel scanning strategy based on category probability sorting, which independently ranks and scans features for each category according to confidence from high to low.

Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70. RoCo-Sim fills a critical gap in roadside perception simulation. Code and pre-trained models will be released soon: this https URL",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10406,RealGeneral: Unifying Visual Generation via Temporal In-Context Learning with Video Models,"Yijing Lin, Mengqi Huang, Shuhan Zhuang, Zhendong Mao","Unifying diverse image generation tasks within a single framework remains a fundamental challenge in visual generation. While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10403,Hyper3D: Efficient 3D Representation via Hybrid Triplane and Octree Feature for Enhanced 3D Shape Variational Auto-Encoders,"Jingyu Guo, Sensen Gao, Jia-Wang Bian, Wanhu Sun, Heliang Zheng, Rongfei Jia, Mingming Gong","Recent 3D content generation pipelines often leverage Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode shapes into compact latent representations, facilitating diffusion-based generation. Efficiently compressing 3D shapes while preserving intricate geometric details remains a key challenge. Existing 3D shape VAEs often employ uniform point sampling and 1D/2D latent representations, such as vector sets or triplanes, leading to significant geometric detail loss due to inadequate surface coverage and the absence of explicit 3D representations in the latent space. Although recent work explores 3D latent representations, their large scale hinders high-resolution encoding and efficient training. Given these challenges, we introduce Hyper3D, which enhances VAE reconstruction through efficient 3D representation that integrates hybrid triplane and octree features. First, we adopt an octree-based feature representation to embed mesh information into the network, mitigating the limitations of uniform point sampling in capturing geometric distributions along the mesh surface. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid latent space representation that integrates a high-resolution triplane with a low-resolution 3D grid. This design not only compensates for the lack of explicit 3D representations but also leverages a triplane to preserve high-resolution details. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper3D outperforms traditional representations by reconstructing 3D shapes with higher fidelity and finer details, making it well-suited for 3D generation pipelines.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Savchenko,"This article presents our results for the eighth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) competition. We combine facial emotional descriptors extracted by pre-trained models, namely, our EmotiEffLib library, with acoustic features and embeddings of texts recognized from speech. The frame-level features are aggregated and fed into simple classifiers, e.g., multi-layered perceptron (feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer), to predict ambivalence/hesitancy and facial expressions. In the latter case, we also use the pre-trained facial expression recognition model to select high-score video frames and prevent their processing with a domain-specific video classifier. The video-level prediction of emotional mimicry intensity is implemented by simply aggregating frame-level features and training a multi-layered perceptron. Experimental results for three tasks from the ABAW challenge demonstrate that our approach significantly increases validation metrics compared to existing baselines.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

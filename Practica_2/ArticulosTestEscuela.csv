10.1016/j.cmet.2025.02.007,Dietary timing enhances exercise by modulating fat-muscle crosstalk via adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling,"Jianghui Chen,Jing Xiang,Meiyu Zhou,Rongfeng Huang,Jianxin Zhang,Yuanting Cui,Xiaoqing Jiang,Yang Li,Runchao Zhou,Haoran Xin,Jie Li,Lihua Li,Sin Man Lam,Jianfang Zhu,Yanxiu Chen,Qingyuan Yang,Zhifu Xie,Guanghou Shui,Fang Deng,Zhihui Zhang,Min-Dian Li","Feeding rhythms regulate exercise performance and muscle energy metabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating adipocyte functions remain unclear. Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance.",12/03/2025,Cell metabolism

The mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Here, in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies SFRP2 as a potential stromal regulator of the abscopal effect. SFRP2 exhibits cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-specific expression and radioimmunotherapy-mediated upregulation in unirradiated tumors. Conditional Sfrp2 knockout in CAFs boosts the abscopal effect by rewiring the vascular-immune microenvironment to promote CD8 + T cell recruitment to unirradiated tumors. In vivo lineage tracing reveals that elevated SFRP2 correlates with radioimmunotherapy-driven pericyte lineage commitment. Serum proteomics reveals that irradiated-tumor-secreted PAI-1 triggers distant tumor pericyte cell-fate transition into SFRP2 high CAFs via the LRP1/p65 axis. Pharmacologically blocking SFRP2 or PAI-1 enhances the abscopal effect in humanized patient-derived xenograft models. Our findings collectively illustrate that PAI-1-induced SFRP2 high CAFs serve as critical stromal regulator to hijack the abscopal effect, providing promising targets for enhancing radioimmunotherapy effectiveness.",12/03/2025,Cancer cell
